"Xbox","Advent Rising is a third-person, science fiction action-adventure video game. It was developed by GlyphX Games and published by Majesco. The game was released on May 31, 2005 for Xbox and on August 9, 2005 for Microsoft Windows. The story of this game was created by Donald Mustard, and featured a script written by science fiction writers Orson Scott Card and Cameron Dayton. The full orchestral soundtrack was done by Tommy Tallarico. As of September 14, 2006, Steam began offering Advent Rising for download as well as other games by Majesco. (Advent Rising on Steam) At release on Steam, it cost $14.95 USD.

Advent Rising was the first in a planned trilogy which also saw the development of a game that would take place alongside Advent Rising, called Advent Shadow for the PSP. However, the game’s retail performance fell short of expectations. By the end of 2005, Majesco Entertainment had completely revised its business plan to focus towards handheld games and canceled plans for future Advent Rising games.","Majesco Entertainment","No","Advent Rising","","","T","Action, Adventure","","7.8","2005-05-31","Glyphx","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$5.00","$5.00","2013-03-22","","","096427012894","991394","2019-01-03 15:06:44",Collection

"DS","Players move into a living, breathing world inside the Nintendo DS... and then invite their friends to visit from anywhere on earth. In Animal Crossing: Wild World, the sequel to the popular Nintendo GameCube game, players and up to three friends can hang out in the same village and interact in real time -- either through wireless LAN or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players can visit a friend’s village from thousands of miles away. The touch screen makes item management and world navigation a breeze. Typing letters and designing patterns are now just stylus strokes away. Days and seasons pass in real time, so whether players want to decorate their homes, catch bugs or fish, collect brand-new items like hats and sunglasses or just chat with the wild and wacky characters in their villages, there’s always something to do.","Nintendo","No","Animal Crossing: Wild World","","","E","Role Playing Game, Simulation","","8.8","2005-12-05","Nintendo","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","$0.00","$0.00","2011-12-11","Complete In Case","GameStop - ???","045496735920","900739","2019-01-03 20:17:18",Collection

"Xbox 360","Assassin’s Creed II is an epic historical action-adventure stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and OS X. It is the second video game installment of the Assassin’s Creed series, and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game Assassin’s Creed. The frame story is set in the 21st century, with player-controlled protagonist Desmond Miles escaping from Abstergo Industries with an employee, Lucy Stillman, after being forced to relive the genetic memories of ancestral assassin Altaïr Ibn-La’Ahad through a machine known as the ”Animus”. After escaping from Abstergo, Desmond enters a device which is more advanced than the original Animus, the Animus 2.0, and relives the genetic memories of ancestral nobleman Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who lived during the Renaissance period of the late 15th and early 16th centuries in Italy. The player controls Ezio, who becomes an Assassin after his father and brothers are murdered by a traitor to their family.

"Wii U","Assassin’s Creed III is a 2012 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows. It is the fifth major installment in the Assassin’s Creed series, and a direct sequel to 2011’s Assassin’s Creed: Revelations. The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and Microsoft Windows release following in November 2012.

The plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The story proper is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1753 to 1783, and follows Desmond’s half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, Ratonhnhaké:ton (/ˈrəduːnˈhəɡeɪduːn/), also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars’ attempts to gain control of the colonies.

Assassin’s Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor’s combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team based objectives including assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game engine, Anvil Next, for the game.[11]

The game received mostly positive reviews from critics and was a massive commercial success, selling more than 12 million copies worldwide. A continuation of the series, entitled Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, was released in October 2013, and follows Ratonhnhaké:ton’s grandfather - Edward Kenway - a pirate and Assassin operating in the Caribbean.[12]","Ubisoft","No","Assassin’s Creed III","","","M","Action, Adventure, Stealth","","8.5","2012-11-18","Ubisoft Montreal","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","Blu-Ray Disc","","1","Colored Snap Case","1","","$0.00","2019-12-28","Complete In Case","GameStop - Nacogdoches","008888187233","1214326","2020-03-02 12:47:13",Collection

"Game Boy Advance","Known in Japan as Tetsuwan Atomu, the Treasure-developed GBA game is based off the new Astro Boy cartoon that’s currently airing on Japanese television. But even if you’re only familiar with Tezuka’s original manga or the 1980s show, you should recognize much of what’s included. The makers of the game created an original story by putting together bits and pieces from the various episodes of the TV show. It feels somewhat like a collage of all things Astro Boy that’s split into seven episodes each consisting of multiple gameplay and story sequences. The game itself takes two forms: side scrolling action and side scrolling shooting.","Sega","","Astro Boy Omega Factor","","","E","Action, Platform, Side Scrolling","","8.8","2004-08-17","Treasure","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Cardboard Box","1","$30.00","$30.00","2013-05-01","Complete In Box","???","010086600278","1112367","2019-01-03 15:06:44",Collection
"Wii","Astro Boy is a science fiction series set in a future world in which robots coexist with humans. It is based on the adventures of Astro Boy (often and simply named “Astro”), a powerful robot created by the head of the Ministry of Science, Dr. Tenma (aka ‘Dr. Astor Boyton II’ in the English version of the 1960s) to replace his son Tobio (‘Thomas’ in the French version of the 1960s; ‘Toby’ in the English version of the 1980s and in the 2009 film), died in a car accident (which ran away in the 2003 anime; evaporated in the 2009 film). Dr. Tenma builds Astro in the image of Tobio and raises it out of love as he would have done with his real son Tobio. But he soon realizes that the robot cannot fill the void left by his son, because Astro could neither express the character traits of a human, nor age as every human does. In the original 1960 edition, Tenma rejects Astro and sells it to a cruel circus director, Hamegg.

Later, we see that Astro was endowed with extraordinary powers and an exceptional ability to fight. Astro fights evil, crime and injustice. Most of his enemies are robots that hate humans, who have gone crazy, or alien invaders. Almost all episodes involved Astro in a fight with other robots.","D3 Publisher","No","Astro Boy: The Video Game","Astro Boy","","E10+","Action","","","2009-10-20","High Voltage Software","2","Canada","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","","1","Snap Case","1","","","","Complete In Case","","879278340107","1466385","2023-09-30 14:14:20",Collection

"NES","Another game from the kings of crap, not THQ, LJN; if you didn’t already know, this game is based on the hit movie Back To The Future (or BttF). You play as Marty and you’re trying to set time straight while getting back to the future. The plot of the game doesn’t really follow the movie that well, but then again the game doesn’t really need a plot. From the looks of it LJN rushed this game (they were a little late don’t you think, the movie came out in 85, this game came out in 89).

Graphics: Uhh...let me start off simple, the graphics are bad. The main character, Marty, doesn’t have the slightest resemblance to anything. In the mini-games you can sort of tell that it COULD be Marty. You would think that the mini-games would have better graphics than the running scenes, but sadly they’re not much better. Everything is blotchy and the character animations are sad, with maybe only three animations to each main character. The backgrounds in games are hard to mess up, but somehow BttF pulled it off. The colors in them are all wrong and they pretty much use the same scenery over and over. Bad, bad, bad...

Sound: This is NES music at its worst. It’s like the days of the Atari sound all over again. The music is the same crappy tune throughout the whole game. It’s a really an annoying 6 second tune, too. In other words, it gets old, quick. In the mini-games there isn’t really music at all (except for the guitar mini-game which really isn’t that bad...). Then come the sound effects. They’re the same Atari sounding bleeps and bloops that the music are. They also quickly become annoying. Overall every bit of sound in this game is bad. You might think of it like ”Wow Atari dude, that’s oldskool!” but trust me, it’s nowhere near like that.

Gameplay: For some reason the developers didn’t make anything that you do in the game follow the movie. The bad guys range from bees to hula-hoop girls, and the weapon you use is a bowling ball. What you do in this game is run down the street in a helicopter view of Marty. In the street, the screen scrolls on its own, and you have to collect clocks so that your family doesn’t disappear. You can get a skateboard that makes you go faster and helps out a lot in the game. The annoying part is the timer. It goes super fast and barely gives you enough time to beat each street segment. The street segment is pretty much a shooter game. Once you beat each street segment you will then go to a mini-game, in all, there are 4 mini-games:

Lou’s Diner- In this one you stand behind the counter and must shoot milk shakes at the bad guys who come towards you. The view in this game totally throws you off, it’s a semi-3d view that’s really confusing. To beat it you have to hit 50 bad guys and you get one ”super” milkshake (which really doesn’t do jack).

The School- This one has the same weird semi-3d view as the diner, except now you have to block hearts from your mom. The hearts move amazingly fast. I was playing it one day, and my friend told me he had never seen anyone’s eyes move back and forth so fast.

The Dance- Out of all the mini-games this one is probably the most fun. You stand on stage and have to catch the guitar notes that fly from both sides of the screen. For some reason all the music turns your parents on, and when the meter hits the top they kiss.

The Car- This is the last mini-game you play before the game is over. You have to drive down this road while keeping the car at exactly 88mph. It is actually not as hard as it sounds.

Replay: Many people seem to think this game is difficult, but really it is not all that hard. After you play the mini-games a couple of times you start to realize they’re not all that hard. If you get the skateboard in the street levels, you can become unstoppable. The bees are probably the most frustrating in this game. They’ll start to come from all sides, and they constantly swarm around you. For some reason I found this game strangely addicting. Maybe it was the crappy music blended with the bland gameplay, who knows, but I just couldn’t put the game down. It made me want to play over and over. I think it comes off as one of those ”so bad its really good” type of things. Even after I beat, I found it addicting, finally I told myself over and over how bad the game was, and all my BttF worries went away.

......BOTTOM LINE: BttF is another one of LJN’s games that were produced for the sole reason of cashing in on the movie. LJN made a lot of other games like that, most being horrid as well. Don’t give in to the power of BttF, stay away at all costs, even if you are a fan of the movie.","Ljn Toys Ltd.","No","Back To The Future","","","E","Action, Adventure","","","1989-09-25","Electric Dreams Software","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","Cartridge","No","0","Box Set","1","","","","","","023582051673","1338159","2019-01-03 15:06:02",Collection

"Xbox 360","Bayonetta (ベヨネッタ Beyonetta?) is a third-person action game video game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 developed by Platinum Games in cooperation with publisher Sega. The game centers on its title character, Bayonetta, who uses her four pistols and magical attacks to defeat enemies. Its developers designed its characters with modern style and fashion in mind, and composed for it a largely upbeat soundtrack. Bayonetta will be a playable character in the upcoming game, Anarchy Reigns.

Development of the game started around January 2007, and it was released in Japan in late October 2009, with a U.S. release following in January 2010. It has been promoted through a television commercial with music by Japanese pop singer MiChi, look-alike searches, a theme for the Google Chrome web browser, a photo book, and soundtracks. In the U.S. and the UK, commercials have featured La Roux’s ”In for the Kill (Skream’s Let’s Get Ravey Remix)”.[1]

Critical reviews have praised its easily learned yet deep combat, fast pace, boss battles, time slowdown or ”Witch Time” mechanic, and character and stage designs. The game has sold over 1.35 million units worldwide.","Platinum Games","No","Bayonetta","","","M","Adventure","","1090","2010-01-05","Platinum Games","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$17.99","$17.99","","","","010086680324","898126","2019-01-03 15:05:54",Collection

"DS","Bejeweled Twist features a revolutionary new style of play and removes the barriers of traditional match-3 games. Instead of swapping adjacent jewels to make a set, players rotate an entire 2x2 block of gems clockwise in an effort to create a line of three or more gems of the same type. Additionally, in Bejeweled Twist, players don’t have to make a match with every move – instead they can freely rotate gems anywhere on the board, allowing far greater liberty of movement and vastly increased strategic freedom to plan combinations, cascades and chains.
Bejeweled Twist DS contains even more gameplay action, including three additional game modes: Zen (for a quick stress-busting experience), Blitz (for past-paced action to challenge even the most hardcore players) and Challenge (featuring infinite action and multiple levels of difficulty).","PopCap Games","No","Bejeweled Twist","","","E","Puzzle","","7.0","2000-12-31","Griptonite Games","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","","","Snap Case","1","","$7.47","2020-01-23","Used","Complete in Case

"Xbox","Bionicle: The Game (also known as Lego Bionicle and titled on the cover as simply Bionicle) is an action-adventure video game released in 2003. The game is based on parts of the movie Bionicle: Mask of Light and other parts of the Bionicle storyline. Initially, the game was supposed to make each Toa, Toa Nuva, and the Toa of Light playable, but due to deadlines, much of the game was dropped. However, you can play as all the characters in the Game Boy Advance version. The Mac OS X version of the game was released by Feral Interactive.","Argonaut Games","","Bionicle","","","E","Action, Adventure, Educational, Fantasy, Fighting, Real Time Strategy","","","1969-12-31","Electronic Arts/EA Games","","United States","","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$3.99","$3.99","2013-03-02","","","014633146813","1001008","2019-01-03 15:06:41",Collection

After defeating The Destroyer, a valuable mineral called ”Eridium” started flourishing through Pandora’s crust. Handsome Jack, a member of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and makes use of it to take over the corporation.

"Game Boy Advance","In a time long ago, peace was maintained by a race of people called the Dragon Clan, who had the ability to transform into magnificent and powerful beasts. One day, a goddess named Myria appeared and created dissention amongst the clan, by offering to grant any wish to those who earned her favor. The clan divided into two factions, Light and Dark, and waged war upon each other, until a great hero emerged from the Light Dragons and sealed away the goddess using six magical keys, which were then scattered and hidden throughout the world to prevent Myria from returning.

Obsessed with obtaining the goddess’s power, Emperor Zog, the leader of the Dark Dragons, ordered the keys found and the Light Dragons hunted to extinction. Forced into isolation, the last surviving members of the clan settle in the village of Drogan, but it isn’t long before Zog’s forces track them down and set fire to the village.

In a last-ditch effort to save her people, the Priestess Sara turns the remaining Light Dragons to stone (including her younger brother Ryu) to protect them from the flames, before sacrificing herself to the Dark Dragons. She is subsequently captured by Zog’s first lieutenant, Jade.

When the spell wears off, Ryu awakens to find his sister missing. He then embarks on a quest to find Sara and to prevent Emperor Zog from obtaining the Goddess Keys.","Capcom","No","Breath Of Fire","","","E","Fantasy, Role Playing Game","","Cart only","2001-12-14","Capcom","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","","Cardboard Box","1","$7.00","$7.00","2011-12-02","Complete In Box","Craigslist","013388280049","1383865","2019-01-03 15:06:05",Collection

"Game Boy Advance","500 years after the original Breath of Fire, a new legend begins with Ryu, a descendant of the now-fabled Dragon Clan. As a young child, Ryu falls asleep next to the remains of a large dragon near his hometown of Gate, only to find that when he awakens, the world around him has mysteriously changed. His father and sister have vanished, and no one else in town recognizes him. The only solace he can find is in the Church of St. Eva, where he is taken in as an orphan.

While exploring a nearby cave with his new friend Bow, Ryu encounters a frightening demon who leaves him alive, but cryptically refers to him as the ”Destined Child”. Ten years later, Ryu and Bow have taken a job as Rangers. While investigating the case of a lost pet, a bizarre series of events lead them to suspect that a sinister force may be at work in the world. Enlisting the help of a new generation of heroes, Ryu must journey deep into the earth to eliminate the source of the evil before it is too late.","Capcom","","Breath of Fire II","","","E","Fantasy, Role Playing Game","","","2002-04-16","Ubisoft","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","","","Cardboard Box","1","$7.00","$7.00","2011-12-02","Complete In Box","Craigslist","3307210325518","1044786","2019-01-03 15:06:05",Collection

"Xbox 360","The latest creation from gaming icon Tim Schafer and the award-winning team at Double Fine, Brütal Legend is a 3rd person action/adventure game starring Jack Black in the role of roadie Eddie Riggs, who sets on an epic quest to build an army of rockers with only a broad axe, a big block V8 and his faithful guitar in hand. Eddie Riggs has been drawn back through time to a mythical world dripped in rock and roll folklore; where great metal titans once ruled and power chords rang from the countryside for all to hear. When an oppressed people request Eddie’s knowledge of modern warfare, he pulls from his own experience in the only occupation he’s ever had, a roadie for a heavy metal band. From this springs the most hellacious army man has ever seen, and this brings this ancient world into the Age of Metal.","Electronic Arts","No","Brutal Legend","","","M","Adventure","","9.0","2009-10-13","Double Fine Productions","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$4.49","$4.49","2013-03-15","","","014633193688","1196545","2019-01-03 15:07:02",Collection

"Xbox 360","Bulletstorm brings new furor to first-person shooter action thanks to its signature ’kill with skill’ gameplay. The game tells the story of a futuristic confederation protected by an elite band of mercenaries: Dead Echo. When Dead Echo members Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato learn they’ve been working for the wrong side, they’re betrayed by their commander and exiled to the far reaches of the galaxy. In Bulletstorm, Grayson and Ishi find themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs in an abandoned paradise. They have two objectives: get off the planet alive, and exact revenge on the man who sent them there.Players step into the role of Grayson Hunt complete with an arsenal of over-the-top combat moves and outrageously large guns. Bulletstorm’s array of distinct ’skillshots’ produces unprecedented levels of frantic gameplay and yell-inducing satisfaction. The skillshot system rewards players for inciting mayhem in the most creative way possible.

"NES","You are Simon Belmont of the Belmont clan. Count Dracula has appeared and it’s your job to rid the world of him. You are armed with your trusty whip and have the ability to pick up an item that you find in the game as a secondary weapon. The secondary weapons include a throwing knife, axe, and boomerang as well as a stopwatch to freeze enemies and holy water that has the ability to make multiple hits very quickly. The game plays through in a linear fashion with no multiple paths to choose from. The screen scrolls in many different directions though it is limited to the basics of moving either left or right and the occasional tower climb.

"Game Boy Advance","Gamers have been enjoying Castlevania’s eerie storylines since 1987, and the latest version of Castlevania for Game Boy Advance is one of the very best in the series. Powered by Game Boy Advance’s 32-bit color graphics, Circle of the Moon looks great and sounds even better. The haunting music tracks and awesome sound effects are some of the greatest audio treats we’ve ever heard on a portable system. Turn down the sound on this one and you’ll be losing a great deal of the gloomy atmosphere which is crucial to the Castlevania experience. Circle of the Moon relies heavily on the platform-jumping skeleton-whipping formula which led to Castlevania’s initial success, but Konami has created some new gameplay elements which add to its depth. Instead of simply working your way from point A to point B in Dracula’s castle, you can choose your own route through branching passageways and corridors. The gameplay is mostly linear, but you’ll definitely make a few wrong turns before figuring out where you’re supposed to go next","Konami","","Castlevania: Circle of the Moon","","","T","Adventure","","9.0","2001-11-06","Konami","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Cardboard Box","1","$21.95","$21.95","2013-05-01","Complete In Box","D-Pad San Marcos","083717500018","1087277","2019-01-03 15:06:44",Collection

"Xbox 360","Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a video game in the Castlevania series, and a reboot of the franchise. It is an action-adventure game in a horror/fantasy setting in Southern Europe during the Middle Ages. The game was developed by MercurySteam and Kojima Productions and published by Konami. Hideo Kojima, producer of the Metal Gear franchise, was involved with the title.
The game was originally announced as Lords of Shadow with no connection to the Castlevania series mentioned. According to Konami, this was to keep their plans to radically change the direction of the Castlevania mythos a secret and to prevent the announcement of the game from upstaging their other series release at the time, Castlevania Judgment.

Development

Longtime producer of the Metal Gear series, Hideo Kojima, had an advisory role in the game’s development.
There were a number of prototypes in parallel development competing to continue development as the next Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original IP when it was first greenlit as a Castlevania title. They eventually asked them to cease work on Lords of Shadow while it was still in its early stages, until Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was to remake the first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords of Shadow still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.
Kojima’s involvement in the development of the game allowed him to assist with things based on his creative viewpoint. Examples include advising Cox’s team to redesign some of the lead character, Gabriel, who he felt needed a ”more heroic face”. Originally, Gabriel’s design resembled a classic barbarian, before Kojima then advised the staff to refine him into a character that was more relatable for the player. David Cox mentioned ”you can see a little bit” of Robert Carlyle’s visage in Gabriel, who provides the voice for the character. Kojima also oversaw the Japanese localization of the game, employing a number of voice actors from the Japanese versions of Metal Gear Solid. Cox stated that he has otherwise allowed them a lot of freedom with the project. MercurySteam wanted to depart from the art style of the other games in favour of one that was darker. Cox further elaborated, saying ”The old games had this boyish depiction of vampires and monsters and we wanted them to have a darker edge this time around.” The gaming press have drawn comparisons between the art style and Guillermo del Toro’s work.
The developers claimed to avoid the use of quick time events during combat, stating that it distracted the player from the action, but the game features several instances. When the game was 60% complete, MercurySteam were aiming for 30 frames per second performance, as opposed to 60 frames, which they said was not a priority at that stage. The game reached gold status following an announcement on Twitter made by David Cox on September 9, 2010. There is DLC available, furthering the game’s plot.
Audio
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow Soundtrack
Soundtrack album by Óscar Araujo
ReleasedOctober 5, 2010 (North America)
GenreVideo game soundtrack
The game’s musical score was written by Spanish composer Óscar Araujo using a 120-piece orchestra. It also features previous Castlevania musical themes. A soundtrack CD was also included in limited editions of the game, with twenty tracks in total. Araujo was nominated by the International Film Music Critics Association for breakout composer of the year for his work on Lords of Shadow. He won ”Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media.”
Lords of Shadow features voiced dialogue by a professional cast recorded in London; an aspect which has been acclaimed by the gaming press. Of note is Robert Carlyle, and Sir Patrick Stewart as the swordsman Zobek. The part of Gabriel was originally going to be offered to Gerard Butler, but he was not available. The cast would make their own contributions to the characters during the recordings. ”What could have been an ‘in and out’ voiceover job for them wasn’t. Instead, their love of the script and praise saw them developing their characters and working through the motivations for them.”

Reception

Film Music Critics AssociationBest Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media.
During its development, Lords of Shadow was placed on several lists for most anticipated video games. GameTrailers ranked it at number 7 for Top 10 Most Anticipated Games of 2010. Explicit Gamer wrote ”With so many great games in store for us in 2010, you should be sure not to overlook Castlevania: Lords of Shadow when it hits the shelves.” Games Radar placed Lords of Shadow at number 26 for 100 Most Anticipated Games of 2010, stating that ”This could be a megaton release.” 1UP.com’s top 50 most anticipated games of E3 2010 ranked Lords of Shadow at number 17. Following the event, the game won the People’s Choice Award. Despite the heavy anticipation, Cox noted there was still a small number of fans who did not like the game’s transition to the 3D format. While he acknowledged this, he asserted ”Fair enough, some people aren’t going to like what we’re doing and we accept that but generally what we’re trying to do is bring the fans with us ... there’s no point in going back and making the same game again – the point is to make a clean break and move forward with the series.”
Reaction to Lords of Shadow was mostly positive. GamesMaster described the game as ”a strong contender for action game of the year. The triumphant reimagining the series has always deserved.” Official Xbox Magazine lauded the size of the game’s content, writing ”... [it] is big. Actually, big’s too little a word. It’s monolithic... From the Resi 4 mood of the scarecrow puzzle to the unexpected oddity of the music box level, this is a game that seemingly hasn’t heard of DLC – and decides to offer you immense value for money instead.” The publication concluded it was ”an epic and slightly unexpected triumph”. Despite its reception, Lords of Shadow was not without criticism. Some reviews noted that it was very derivative of other games and that it was unlike the classic Castlevania series. GameSpot’s review calls the game ”a good start for a series in need of some new blood – so to speak – it’s just unfortunate so much of it comes from other games and not an original source.” 1UP’s review states, ”altogether, the game spins an interesting tale, and though it might borrow some ideas a little heavily from certain other games, it implements them well.”","Konami","No","Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow","","","M","Adventure","","9.5","2010-10-05","Mercury Steam","1","Canada","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","2","Colored Snap Case","1","$34.99","$34.99","","","","083717300885","1449577","2019-01-03 15:06:03",Collection

"Xbox 360","Conan is a 2007 action-adventure video game that puts players in control of the titular hero, Conan the Barbarian, from Robert E. Howard’s fantasy literature. The game was published by THQ for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game consoles. Its developer, Nihilistic Software, was inspired by the God of War and Ninja Gaiden video games to create an experience featuring gore and nudity.

In Conan, the hero is on a quest to recover his lost armor and defeat an evil wizard. Conan can fight with sword and shield, two-handed weapons, or a weapon in each hand. Starting with several basic attacks, the barbarian gains experience points by killing enemies. By exchanging these points for additional attacks, players improve the hero’s fighting abilities. Magic powers complement Conan’s arsenal, including the abilities to turn enemies into stone and conjure firestorms. The game also features context-sensitive action sequences in which players press a sequence of buttons displayed on the screen to complete actions such as killing powerful enemies and interacting with the environment.

Critics enjoyed Conan’s combat system and gory kills, but said that the game failed to match the experience offered in God of War. Reactions varied on the game’s depiction of the Conan universe; several critics praised the emulation of Frank Frazetta’s famous artwork, but others found the game’s graphics drab and of low resolution. Regarding the audio, Golden Globe-winning actor Ron Perlman was both praised and criticized for his voice work as Conan. Composer Mike Reagan received acclaim for the game’s music and later gave live performances of the game’s soundtrack at Video Games Live shows. Despite the generally favorable reviews and commercial success of the Conan franchise, Conan sold poorly and was a financial loss for THQ.

"Xbox","Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge is a first-party video game developed by FASA Studio (part of Microsoft Game Studios) for the Xbox. The game was later made available for download on the Xbox 360 from the Xbox Live Marketplace. The game, like the earlier Crimson Skies for the PC, is an action-oriented arcade flight game. Nonetheless, there are significant differences between the gameplay of High Road to Revenge and that of the original PC title. For example, while the Xbox game has a more open-ended mission structure, it offers less plane customization than the PC game.[3]

Set in an alternate 1930s in which the plane and Zeppelin become the primary means of transportation, the game focuses on the adventures of Nathan Zachary, leader of the Fortune Hunters sky pirate gang. Players assume his role as he undertakes a crusade to avenge the death of his old friend, ”Doc” Fassenbiender.

The game was originally announced in March 2002 for a release that fall.[4] However, developers postponed the release date to give them time to retool the game. As a result of this overhaul, which delayed the game’s publication to October 2003, several issues were addressed and new features added, most notably the addition of Xbox Live support.[5] Critically the game was very well received, most notably for its graphics, audio, gameplay, and Xbox Live features.[6][7]","Microsoft Game Studios","","Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge","","","T","Flight Simulator","","9.1","2003-10-21","FASA","4","Canada","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$4.00","$4.00","2013-03-22","","","805529097681","1572815","2019-01-03 15:06:44",Collection

"Wii","Standing in Lhando, the eerily deserted village at the base of the Sacred Mountain of the Himalayas, Chomolonzo, an icy chill hits your veins. The summit looming in the distance holds the answers to your brother’s disappearance, and you plan to bring him back – dead or alive. Cursed Mountain is a survival/horror game designed specifically for Wii. Players will take on the role of Eric Simmons as he tracks down his brother, who went missing on a trek into the Himalayas to find an ancient Buddhist artifact. A sensible man, when Eric first encounters the angry spirits of the dead, he dismisses them as hallucinations caused by altitude sickness. But as he ascends the mountain, it becomes clear that something is very wrong... A curse has been placed on the mountain; the dead spirits of the local monks and villagers are trapped in the realm of the afterlife or bardo, unable to reach Nirvana or start a new life cycle. Stuck in limbo, the restless spirits are very angry... Features • Revolutionary - One of the first survival/horror games designed specifically for Wii, Cursed Mountain creates a terrifying setting in a stylized, atmospheric manner.
• Original Setting - With advanced graphics, Cursed Mountain places the player in a realistic Himalayan environment. Players will immerse themselves in the local Buddhist traditions and rituals. Everything in the game is based on real world facts and research…except of course for the outbreak of restless souls.
• Vertical Level Design - As players ascend the mountain, they will clearly see the summit in the distance, a looming reminder of their final destination, and they can also look behind to see how far they’ve come.
• Innovative Wii Controls - Designed to mimic the physical aspects of sacred prayer rituals, mantras, and gestures of Buddhism, combat is comprised of gestures that release the spirits from the curse. In addition, Cursed Mountain takes full advantage of Wii functionality, supporting the Wii Remote speaker, rumble and motion-sensitivity in a variety of triggered action events that mimic natural movements, such as climbing, running and balancing.
• Compelling Storyline - Players investigate the disappearance of their brother who vanished while searching for an ancient relic in the Himalayas. Players climb to the top of Chomolonzo to discover the fate of their brother as well as to stop the curse that’s interrupting Samsara – the Buddhist concept of reincarnation.
• Environmental Hazards - As players climb higher, the mountain itself becomes an enemy. Prone to the travails of altitude sickness and oxygen deprivation, players may not be able to tell the difference between real enemies and hallucinated ones.","Deep Silver","","Cursed Mountain","","","M","Adventure","","7.5","2009-08-25","Deep Silver","1","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$8.99","$8.99","2013-07-12","","","895678002148","993884","2019-01-03 15:06:55",Collection

The second and more terrible is that his beloved Beatrice has been murdered, and her soul pulled down into hell by a dark force.

"Xbox 360","Dark Souls (ダークソウル Dāku Souru) is a video game developed by From Software, who will also publish the game as an exclusive title for the PlayStation 3 in Japan. Namco Bandai Games will serve as publisher of the game for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for all other regions. It was previously developed under the codename Project Dark and is the spiritual successor to Demon’s Souls. Dark Souls was released in Japan, for the PlayStation 3, on September 22, 2011, and for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, on October 4 in North America and on October 7 in Europe of the same year.

Reception

Famitsu gave the game a highly positive review, scoring it 37 out of 40, based on four scores of 9, 9, 9, and 10. This was much higher than its predecessor Demon’s Souls which received a score of 29 out of 40, based on four scores of 7, 9, 6, and 7. One of the reviewers for Dark Souls described it as ”a very hardcore dark-fantasy RPG” that is ”role-playing right down to the roots,” and stated that the ”massive field map and powerful enemies serve to rev up both your sense of adventure and your sense of dread.” Another reviewer stated that ”the sheer happiness you get after the trial-and-error pays off and you overcome the challenge is absolutely impossible to replicate”.
Gamespot scored Dark Souls a 9.5/10, complimenting just about every aspect of it. Much praise was given to the online system, as well as the sense of jubilation felt when conquering boss fights after numerous failed attempts. They also suggested that casual gamers may struggle with making progress in the game, whereas, RPG enthusiasts will thrive on the difficulty.
IGN gave Dark Souls a 9.0/10, praising the game’s very well-thought out level design, variety, strong emphasis on online features, excessively dark tone and atmosphere and very deep gameplay. They also noted that it is not a game that you can simply jump into and play for plain enjoyment. They went as far to say that it is not a game for the timid and that the game requires both skill and strategy almost all the time. While praising the extremely high difficulty, they stated that ”there’s a difference between punishing, and downright unfair.”
While many are praising Dark Souls for its amazing singleplayer feel and mechanics, a great deal of the fans are deeply displeased by its multiplayer aspects. The developers have only stated that the game is working as intended, but have not made any official statement on whether or not they will do anything about the complaints the many fans have. Andrew ”Cubninja” Gaskill of Co-Optimus had this to say ”This is a truly baffling design decision from FromSoftware which degrades a key feature gamers fell in love with in Demon’s Souls.”","Namco Bandai","No","Dark Souls","","","M","Action, Role Playing Game","","9.0","2011-10-07","From Software","4","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$16.19","$16.19","2013-10-27","","","722674210508","1163072","2019-01-03 15:07:02",Collection

"DS","The console versions of de Blob 2 follow from where de Blob and de blob 2 DS version left off, when it is Prisma City’s general election. A mysterious priest called Papa Blanc, who is actually the villain from the first game, Comrade Black, in disguise, is doing his utmost to rig the outcome of the vote by cheating with an artificial metal arm in each voting booth that presses Blanc, allowing his cult of Inkies to wreak all manner of colour-related havoc on the metropolis. The INKT Corporation, as before, manages to drain all colour from the city and also turns its inhabitants, the Prismans, into generic drones. Once again, it is up to Blob and the members of the Colour Underground to restore the city to its vibrant former glory. Blob frees the lands one by one, as he did in the last game, fighting against many foes, including a massive monster created in a factory accident, as he approaches Comrade Black. Black, however, is shown to be more clever than was suggested in the previous game. At one point, he kidnaps the other members of the Color Underground. Once De Blob frees all of Prisma City, he confronts Comrade Black again, only to discover, as he flees to space once again, that Black had used Blob’s own journey against him, using color beacons that were mysteriously activated as Blob progressed to power an orbiting satellite to enslave the entire planet. As Blob gets closer and closer, Black taunts him and forces him to make a series of choices: continue on, or rescue a few Graydians that Black had placed in biodomes rigged to explode and risk running out of time. Once Blob finally reaches him, Black uses a high-power beam of color to grow gigantic and fight Blob. Once Blob defeats him, Black is sucked into space, and the world returns to normal.","THQ","","De Blob 2","","","E","Platform","","","1969-12-31","halfbrick Studios","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","","Snap Case","1","$9.74","$9.74","2011-08-11","Sealed In Case","???","785138364070","1054086","2019-01-03 15:07:42",Collection

"Wii","Ao iniciarem o jogo o destaque irá certamente para o modo história, que conta o percurso fictício de Kid – um pugilista em ascensão no mundo do boxe – rumo ao estrelato. Na realidade a “aventura” começa no preciso momento em que Kid, já veterano no assunto, se prepara para aquele que poderá ser o grande combate da sua carreira. Enquanto isso, toda a aventura será contada na forma de uma analepse na qual todos os acontecimentos narrados serão referentes ao percurso que vos levará ao acontecimento primário.

Após visionarem o vídeo inicial terão que realizar um tutorial onde irão – pelo menos na teoria – aprender como funcionam os controlos. Digo na teoria, porque enquanto nos vídeos tudo isto funciona muito bem, já na prática terão que esmurraçar muito oxigénio em vão até realizarem a menor das conquistas.

Enquanto vos pedem para realizar apenas um Hook ou um Straight tudo funciona (mais ou menos) bem, mas quando é pedido que realizem uma sequência de movimentos toda a mecânica cai por água abaixo, revelando-se imprecisa e muito pouco (ou nada) divertida. Se o tutorial não vos adaptar aos controlos, pelo menos irá preparar-vos para a frustração que é jogar Don King Boxing.

O Guitar Hero dos pugilistas.
Logo de seguida começa a verdadeira aventura. Inicialmente irão combater em cenários pequenos, algumas vezes com o objectivo de angariar fundos para a caridade (não que isso tenha grande implicância no jogo). Relembro que o grande objectivo é tornarem-se uma estrela e neste jogo esse objectivo significa trabalhar para o Don King, o único capaz de vos dar a projecção que ambicionam. Para isso terão que ir seguindo a corrente de combates que vai surgindo. Cada combate é seguido e antecedido por uma sequência de vídeo onde se relatam acontecimentos relacionados com os objectivos a que se propõem.

Se combater – e consequentemente jogar – é a parte má de Don King Boxing, então ver estes comentários feitos por pessoas reais é sem dúvida a parte mais divertida do jogo. A ideia até é boa e a sua aplicação rasga o razoável. A mecânica do jogo é sempre a mesma: combate, relatos, combate, relatos, e por aí fora.

Da mesma forma, talvez na tentativa de prolongar a longevidade e imprimir alguma variedade ao jogo, são por vezes apresentados alguns combates de lendas do desporto. Mais uma vez a ideia não seria má, o problema é que os controlos são uma porcaria e a opção artística de colocar o ecrã num histórico preto e branco também não ajuda em nada.

O grande problema de Don King Boxing é que os controlos simplesmente não funcionam conforme o devido. São extremamente imprecisos e, pior do que isso, não trazem qualquer diversão. Nesta abordagem sou sincero, diverti-me muito mais ao jogar o Boxe do Wii Sports onde a liberdade e a simplicidade dos controles permite uma acção livre espontânea. Em Don King simplesmente não consegui obter satisfação. O jogo obriga-vos literalmente a aprender Boxe, mas segundo as regras de utilização dos controlos e suas falhas inerentes. Cheguei a esmurraçar com o braço direito enquanto a minha personagem atacava com o braço esquerdo, e vice-versa.

Os modelos dos personagens até estão razoavelmente bem feitos, mas é uma tristeza olhar para as suas caras e ver que tanto lhes faz levar um murro nos tomates como ganhar a final de um torneio. As ocasionais falas dos treinadores são ridículas e a única satisfação que encontrei a nível sonoro foi ouvir o grande Eye of the Tiger.

Têm ainda um modo treino que rastreia as vossas pontuações diárias através de uma série de mini-jogos que no fundo até conseguem ser o melhor deste jogo. Podem dar livremente uns murros no saco, assistir a uma aula de Fitness dando murros de forma coordenada ou ainda saltar a corda – não tem muita graça mas realmente é capaz de ajudar a perder umas calorias.


Hurra! Ganhei! Que felicidade!
No modo Treino é-vos pedido que seleccionem uma personagem personalizável, o que é estúpido pois as únicas personagens personalizáveis que podem escolher são as que já vêm pré-definidas pelo jogo, visto que não existe qualquer editor. No modo Versus de dois jogadores podem escolher entre lutar com estas personagens ou com alguns lutadores conhecidos das classes de pesos leves, médios ou pesados.

Fico com a ideia de que a maior preocupação estava centrada em engrandecer Don King, que nas suas sequências de vídeo aparece sentado num grande cadeirão quase que coberto pela majestosa bandeira Americana. Todo o jogo mais parece uma homenagem ao Don King do que propriamente um serviço prestado ao desporto. E isto percebe-se desde que entram no menu principal, onde a música de abertura conta com um Don King a cantar: “Se eu consegui, tu irás conseguir, e toda a América também”. Não condeno. O problema é que mais cedo ou mais tarde qualquer um se farta desta tamanha gabarolice que é assistida desde o menu principal até as entranhas do modo história.

Sim, como já devem ter percebido Don King Boxing é uma aposta furada da 2K Sports. Colocando de parte todos os defeitos relacionados com a apresentação, som e algumas outras escolhas relacionadas com o modo história, haveria ainda uma grande pedra no sapato relacionada com a jogabilidade. É imprecisa, insatisfatória, frustrante e cansativa, em qualquer sentido da palavra. Se acham que este género continua ainda com uma lacuna por preencher no catálogo da Wii, então Don King Boxing tabém não vem mudar nada.","2K Boston/2K","No","Don King Boxing","","","T","Sports","","5.8","2000-12-31","2K Boston/2K","2","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","","1","Snap Case","1","","","","Complete In Case","","710425343650","990455","2023-09-30 14:06:29",Collection

"3DS","Donkey Kong Country Returns, known as Donkey Kong Returns (ドンキーコング リターンズ Donkī Kongu Ritānzu?) in Japan, is a side-scrolling platform game developed by Retro Studios and released by Nintendo for the Wii console in North America on November 21, 2010, then in Australia, Europe and Japan in December 2010. It is the series’ first traditional home console installment since Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (2005), and also the first Donkey Kong Country entry not to involve British video game developer Rare during its development.

The game’s story focuses on a group of evil creatures called Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe that arrive on Donkey Kong Island, and hypnotize the island’s animals to steal Donkey Kong’s bananas. This forces him to retrieve the hoard with the help of his friend Diddy Kong. The game received generally positive reviews, receiving an average score of 87% on GameRankings and Metacritic, and selling 4.96 million copies worldwide by the end of March 2011.

On February 14, 2013 Nintendo announced that a 3D port titled Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D was in development for the Nintendo 3DS, and was released in Europe and North America on May 24, 2013.","Nintendo","Yes","Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D","","","E","Platform","","8.9","2013-05-24","Nintendo","2","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Snap Case","1","","$27.99","2013-05-23","","","045496742423","1290163","2019-01-03 21:55:42",Collection

"Sega Master System","The player takes control of martial artist Billy Lee, or his twin brother Jimmy (also known as Hammer and Spike in the supplementary materials for the American arcade release), as they fight their way into the turf of the Black Warriors gang in order to rescue their common love interest Marian. The player character has a repertoire of martial art techniques which they can perform by using the joystick and three action buttons (kick, jump, and punch) individually or in combination. Techniques range from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate manoeuvres like hair grabbing moves and elbow strikes. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner’s opponent from behind. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.","Sega","","Double Dragon","","","Family Friendly","Fighting, Role Playing Game","","7.9","1988-10-01","Sega","2","United States","Controller Game Pad","Cartridge","No","1","Thick Snap Case","1","","","","","","010086070125","944450","2019-01-03 15:05:56",Collection

"Wii","Dragon Blade: Wrath of Fire é um jogo lançado exclusivamente para Wii pela D3 Publisher. Dragon Blade segue um jovem aventureiro chamado Dal que procura seis pedaços da lendária ”Dragon Blade”, cada um contendo a alma de um dragão diferente. Em uma tentativa de construir a arma final para vencer o mal, o jovem protagonista embarca em uma busca para encontrar e lacrar cada um dos seis dragões, tendo suas almas e habilidades conquistadas no processo.
O enredo gira em torno de Dal e sua busca para recuperar as seis peças da Dragon Blade e vencer os dragões que ”saquearem” a terra. Ele é acompanhado por um dragão vermelho misterioso chamado Valthorian cuja alma é a fonte dos poderes do Blade Dragon. O enredo foi escrito por Richard A. Knaak.

Dal é atormentado por sonhos repetidos de si mesmo empunhando uma espada de fogo e de ser instruído por uma voz sobre como usá-la (servindo como tutorial do jogo). Uma vez que todos os objetos quebráveis ​​foram incinerados, ele acorda para encontrar sua noiva. Ele diz a ela do seu sonho, e quando ele termina, a aldeia está sob ataque dos monstros que servem os dragões. Depois de instruí-la a correr e se esconder, ele é atraído por uma grande pedra e uma voz desencarnada. Ele é teleportado para uma cavidade subterrânea escondida nas profundezas, onde a alça e cabo para a lâmina de fogo dos seus sonhos está situado. Ele pega a lâmina, e a voz desencarnada se revela como Valthorian, o dragão de fogo que levou favor com a humanidade em tempos de guerra e deu-lhes a força extra de luta para influenciar a vitória para um lado.

Irritado por suas ações, os outros cinco dragões conspirou contra ele, acabou corrompendo a seis pessoas mais confiável de Valthorian. Valthorian acreditava que acabariam por destruídos, e o povo lança um ataque. Incapaz de magoar as pessoas que ele amou uma vez e confiável, Valthorian é assassinado e sua alma selada em órbitas diferentes, pedaços do Dragon Blade. Um dos seis homens, no entanto, lamentou a sua assistência na escritura, tirou a parte e escondeu. Por gerações, a família guardava o tesouro, que era o cabo e punho, até que levou a Dal, o seu último descendente.

Depois de aprender isso, Dal retorna para a aldeia, encontrando-o em chamas. Irritado e com poderes, ele se aproxima do monstro e começa a matá-los. Eventualmente, ele encontra sua noiva a beira da morte, que partilha as suas últimas palavras com ele. Entristecido com a morte dela, ele vai até a área onde os principais líderes do ataque estão residindo. Como se vê, eles estavam procurando a Dragon Blade, que agora exerce Dal. Com todos de sua aldeia fora, ele se estabelece com o Dragon Blade, e pede a Valthorian para matar os que destruiu sua casa e sua noiva.

Passando por várias terras, Dal recupera porções da alma de Valthorian, que é vencida pela morte dos restantes cinco homens corruptos que Valthorian confiava. Os braços, cauda, ​​um chefe de Valthorian é recuperado. Dal mata cada um dos dragões. Ao chegar Vormanax, uma grande luta ocorre, e no final, Valthorian é revivido e mata Vormanax, prendendo sua alma no Dragon Blade para substituí-la. Depois de agradecer Dal, Valthorian percebe que uma parcela mais escura, mais sinistra foi destinado o tempo todo, e que uma força maior do que Vormanax foi responsável por tudo.

Os seis dragões (em ordem de aparição) são

Valthorian - Dragão do Fogo
Jagira - Dragão de Água
Skaroth - Dragão do Submundo
Mobrius - Dragão do Envenenamento
Norgiloth - Dragão da Luz
Vormanax - Dragão das Trevas

"Wii","Endless Ocean: Blue World builds on the ocean experience first introduced with Endless Ocean. While the last game emphasized relaxation, this one is designed with more adventure in mind. Divers might find themselves escaping from or calming down attacking sharks, exploring shipwrecks or finding treasure. Endless Ocean: Blue World also has more creatures and improved graphics designed to fully immerse players in an ocean environment that they can freely explore at their own pace.

* Players dive into oceans all around the world to discover the fish, mammals and various sea creatures unique to each region while learning about their habits and behaviors. By selling salvageable items for money, players can buy decorations for their island and buy coral to attact new kinds of fish to their own private reef
* The ocean is teeming with life. Hundreds of real-life species are there to be discovered, from seahorses to giant whales.
* Are the local fish sick or agitated? Players can view their health status and then use a tranquilizer-like tool to zap the ones in need of rehab with healing energy.
* The game also includes a storyline that players can follow as they choose. The plot involves Oceana, a woman who investigates the Dragons Song, which her father, a prominent ocean explorer, was searching for just before his death.
* While at Nine Ball Island, players can become friends with a dolphin and teach it some new tricks. When on a dive, players can even bring along the dolphin, which players can hold onto for extra fast swimming.","Nintendo","No","Endless Ocean 2: Blue World","Endless Ocean ","2","7+","Adventure, Simulation","","7.0","2010-02-23","Arika","1","Canada","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","","1","Colored Snap Case","1","","","","Complete In Case","","045496901837","1045273","2023-09-30 13:47:22",Collection

"Xbox 360","Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an action adventure platform game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Namco Bandai Games. It was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 5, October 7 and October 8, 2010 in North America, Australia, Japan and Europe respectively.[1][3]

The story is a re-imagining of the ancient Chinese story Journey to the West by Wu Cheng’en, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of China. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the still active war machines left over from the conflict. Like the original story however, the plot revolves around someone who forces the help and protection of a warrior, with many characters sharing the same names and roles. The game’s story was written by Alex Garland, with voice talent and motion capture from Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw.

A tactical action-adventure game, Enslaved centers on the complex relationship between the two main characters and challenges players to employ a mix of combat, strategy and environment traversal.","Namco Bandai","Yes","Enslaved: Odyssey To The West","","","T","Adventure","","8.0","2010-10-05","Ninja Theory","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","","","","","","722674210355","1029940","2019-01-03 15:06:19",Collection
"Wii","A heroic tale of redemption and discovery, Epic Mickey is an action-platforming game featuring the iconic Mickey Mouse in a fantastical adventure inspired by the cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s. Pulled into a warped Disney universe called the Cartoon Wasteland by an evil villain, Mickey finds himself in a world inhabited by the retired and forgotten cartoon characters and attractions from Disney’s past. Mickey must use the very elements of himself and the world, paint and paint thinner, to explore the Cartoon Wasteland, find the source of evil that is destroying the land, and redeem his fellow cartoon characters including Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Walt Disney’s first cartoon star and Mickey’s resentful half-brother. With visionary game designer Warren Spector behind the title, players choose their own path to defeat supreme evil, face the consequences of those decisions and ultimately free the Cartoon Wasteland.","Disney Interactive Studios","No","Epic Mickey","","","E","Adventure, Platform","","8.5","2010-11-30","Junction Point","1","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$21.00","$21.00","","","","712725004576","1043010","2019-01-03 15:06:05",Collection

You play as a rather ordinary character who one day falls in love at the first sight of a particularly hot chick. From then on, the character puts all his energy into getting the girl, only to find numerous obstacles in his way. The game was given its name to deliver the sense of how serious the main character’s attraction is to the girl -- a good thing, because the entire point of the game is to earn the girl’s affection. You use the Nintendo DS’s touch panel to interact with the game and make the girl grow fond of you. The basic gist of the game is to touch the girl via the touch screen. In fact, the game doesn’t even use the standard D-pad and button controls -- it’s all about the touch.","Sega","No","Feel the Magic: XY/XX","","","T","Puzzle","","7.8","2004-11-16","Sonic Team","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","","$2.64","2011-12-14","Used","Complete in Case","010086670004","935932","2019-01-03 18:40:08",Collection

"PSP","Final Fantasy II (ファイナルファンタジーII Fainaru Fantajī Tsū?) is a fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System as the second installment of the Final Fantasy series. The game has received numerous enhanced remakes for the WonderSwan Color, the Sony PlayStation, Japanese mobile phones, the Game Boy Advance, and the PlayStation Portable. Only the PlayStation, Game Boy, and PlayStation Portable versions have been released outside of Japan. As neither this game nor Final Fantasy III were initially released outside of Japan, Final Fantasy IV was originally released in North America as Final Fantasy II, so as not to confuse players. The most recent release of the game is an enhanced version for the iOS, which was released worldwide on February 25, 2010.

The game’s story centers on four youths whose parents were killed during an army invasion by the empire of Palamecia. Three of the four main characters join a rebellion against the empire, embarking on missions to gain new magic and weapons, destroy enemy superweapons, and rescue leading members of the resistance. After defeating the empire and the Emperor, the trio discovers that the fourth youth, now a dark knight, has taken the place of the previous emperor and is preparing to attack the rebellion. Upon confronting him, the Emperor reappears as a demon and prepares to destroy the world. However, the four characters agree to join forces to defeat him, and ultimately they destroy him in his demonic castle. The Game Boy Advance remake adds a bonus story after the game is completed, following several side characters who died during the game as they attempt to defeat an alternate version of the Emperor.

Final Fantasy II introduced many elements that would later become staples of the Final Fantasy franchise, including chocobos and the recurring character Cid. It also eliminated the traditional experience point leveling system of the previous and later games in the series, instead introducing an activity-based progression system where the characters’ statistics increase according to how they are used or acquired. Despite being a sequel to Final Fantasy, the game includes no characters or locations from the first game. Final Fantasy II received little attention at the time from non-Japanese reviewers, though its remakes have garnered favorable reviews.","Square Enix","No","Final Fantasy II","","","T","Role Playing Game","","6.1","2007-07-24","Square Enix","1","United States","Handheld Console","UMD","No","1","Snap Case","1","","","","","","662248907048","956863","2019-01-03 15:05:57",Collection

"Super NES","Final Fantasy III (ファイナルファンタジーIII Fainaru Fantajī Surī?) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square in 1990 for the Family Computer as the third installment in the Final Fantasy series. It is the first numbered Final Fantasy game to feature the job-change system.

The story revolves around four orphaned youths drawn to a crystal of light. The crystal grants them some of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal’s pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive families of their mission and set out to explore and bring back balance to the world.

The game was released in Japan on April 27, 1990. It had never been released outside of Japan until a remake was released on the Nintendo DS on August 24, 2006. At that time, it was the only Final Fantasy game not previously released in North America or Europe. There had been earlier plans to remake the game for Bandai’s WonderSwan Color handheld, as had been done with the first, second, and fourth installments of the series, but the game faced several delays and was eventually canceled after the premature cancellation of the platform. The Nintendo DS version of the game was positively received internationally, selling over one million copies in Japan. The Famicom version of the game was released on the Virtual Console service in Japan on July 21, 2009. An iOS port of the Nintendo DS remake was released on March 24, 2011. An Android version was released on March 12, 2012. A PlayStation Portable version was released on September 20, 2012.

"Xbox 360","Gears of War takes place on the planet Sera. A liquid called Imulsion became a highly valued power source after a scientist discovered how to use it, and the economic shockwave led to several wars between nations. The Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) originally existed only as an obscure world-government philosophy, but it evolved into a legitimate, though minor, political party during the 79-year long Pendulum Wars. After ”Emergence Day,” when the Locust began their attack on humanity, the COG were the ones who took the necessary steps to ensure the survival of human civilization, instituting martial law and taking charge of the effort against the Locust. Fourteen years later, the COG is the only human government left on Sera.","Microsoft Game Studios","No","Gears Of War","","","M","Adventure","","9.4","2006-11-09","Epic Games","2","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","Yes","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$59.99","$59.99","","","","882224054034","890963","2019-01-03 15:06:20",Collection

Part adventure game, part puzzle game, Ghost Trick’s gameplay will challenge player’s brains while its distinctive art style and character designs courtesy of members of Capcom’s Ace Attorney series, will please the eye.

How will you scare off the unwary assassin? There are many routes to choose from but not all of them will be obvious. It’s up to you to solve the crime but be warned, Sissel only has until dawn before he has to leave the supernatural world for good.

"DS","Set in 1991, two years after the events of Ghostbusters 2, this title finds the boys in gray moving onto the next chapter in the world of paranormal investigations and eliminations -- namely, expanding the team. You’ll join the squad as an experimental weapons technician with the sole purpose of testing Egon’s latest Proton Pack modifications. Within moments of showing up on the job, a strange wave of ghostly energy emanates from a museum packing a Gozer exhibit and spreads across New York City. The spiritual spike gets every ghoul in the five boroughs riled up, the boys get to work and a devious master plan is set in motion. 

This game is meant to be the third movie in the franchise, and with that in mind, we have to talk about presentation right off the bat. The game opens detailing the ghostly explosion in a beautiful cutscene -- all the computer-generated movies look great with lots of detail and animations -- and we’re launched into the Ghostbusters theme just like when the Gray Lady scared the librarian in the first movie and when Dana caught up to Oscar’s carriage in the second film. These nifty scenes will continue along with the soundtrack from the original movie throughout the game and setup the tale. There are dips in this presentation value -- which I’ll get to in a bit -- but these touches are pulled right from the movie and drop you into this third-person shooter with a specific story to tell (i.e. don’t expect to choose your next job GTA-style).","Atari","","Ghostbusters: The Video Game","","","E","Action","","6.8","1969-12-31","Atari","","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","","Snap Case","1","$14.99","$14.99","2012-04-14","","","742725277649","907061","2019-01-03 15:06:26",Collection

You play Isaac, a young swordsman and resident of the town of Vale, and at the beginning of the adventure a storm is brewing outside that forces Isaac to flee to safety. But every virtual adventurer knows that it’s never as simple as that, and eventually you’re thrust into the role of the world’s savior, befriending other skilled adventurers that will join your crusade... there’s strength in numbers, as the phrase goes.","Nintendo","No","Golden Sun","","","E","Role Playing Game","","9.7","2001-11-11","Camelot","2","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Cardboard Box","1","$7.00","$7.00","2011-12-02","Complete In Box","Craigslist","045496731489","948654","2019-01-03 15:05:57",Collection

"DS","This special box set includes Guitar Hero on tour game, Guitar Hero on tour decades game, Guitar Hero Guitar Grip and pick stylus.
GH ON TOUR: This portable version of Guitar Hero features the same rhythm-based ”play to the music” gameplay of console game. Guitar Hero: On Tour contains a wealth of licensed songs from bands as Nirvana, OK Go, and No Doubt, allowing gamers to rock out to tunes by some of their own guitar heroes. Players are able to pick from six different guitarists to represent them in-game, with secret venues and outfits to unlock. And in addition to a full Career Mode, the game also has co-op or competitive two-player play, including special ”On Tour” challenges exclusive to the DS game (with power-ups that will send opponents into a frenzied touchscreen autograph session or set their pyrotechnics display to go haywire and require players to blow out the fire.)

"DS","Meet Henry Hatsworth, a quirky, light-hearted character who players will guide on their journey through a new style of gaming adventure on their Nintendo DS. In this two-in-one adventure, players explore five exotic worlds, fight a variety of opponents, and venture through more than 30 levels, including nearly a dozen hidden levels while taking on outrageous world-ending bosses. The separate worlds on the two Nintendo DS screens have a cause and effect inter-relationship, and players choose when to switch between conquering the action-platform realm and mastering the increasingly challenging puzzle world. A wide variety of power-ups help Hatsworth in both of these worlds. Players complete puzzle combinations and defeat puzzle enemies in order to gain power ups, health, and energy to supercharge Hatsworth in his adventure.","Electronic Arts/EA Games","","Henry Hatsworth In The Puzzling Adventure","","","E","Platform, Puzzle","","9.0","2009-03-17","Nintendo","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Snap Case","1","","","","","","014633190489","948861","2019-01-03 20:07:54",Collection

"Wii","Indianapolis 500 Legends é um jogo de automobilismo para o Nintendo Wii, lançado em 2007 produzido pela Torus Games. Neste título, o jogador participa das quinhentas milhas de Indianápolis com carros de 1960 a 1970, com a possibilidade de participar de corridas convencionais ou missões, em que terá que ultrapassar certo número de pilotos em um determinado tempo.
 O visual deste jogo parece ser um passo inferior aos padrões do Wii. As texturas parecem não ter tanto brilho quanto outros jogos de corrida do console, e a física é de regular qualidade. Amassar os clássicos veículos é praticamente impossível neste jogo, sendo o dano mais grave perder uma das rodas, isso quando o impacto é direto nelas.
 Pilotar os veículos não é muito difícil e simplesmente requer um pouco de conhecimento nas pistas. Os sons são bem feitos, destaque para o narrador, que faz uma locução muito próxima do que se pode escutar em uma narração de Indy 500 nos anos 60. Por outro lado, a torcida não soa bem, e é uma pena.
 As licenças de vários pilotos foram conseguidas e torna a experiência bem interessante. Nesta lista compõe os pilotos Al Unser, vencedor da prova por quatro ocasiões, Mario Andretti, AJ Foyt e Bobby Unser. Durante as missões, vale destacar que o jogador pode assumir a posição de um piloto real em uma situação diferente do que ocorreu, como levar Parnelli Jones a vitória em 1967, quanto historicamente o piloto parou na 197ª volta por problemas mecânicos.
 Indianapolis 500 Legends é um bom jogo, altamente recomendado para os fãs de automobilismo, principalmente de competições clássicas. Mas, apesar de sua qualidade sonora e de controle, não é um jogo para se esperar muito, ficando um pouco repetitivo depois de um tempo. O Wii ficou conhecido como “o videogame dos jogos de automobilismo”, tendo muitos títulos bons. Nada espetaculares como Forza 3 ou Gran Turismo 5, mas que valem a pena – como este.

Porque vale a pena: Uma grande idéia e uma boa lista de pilotos.
Porque não vale a pena: Fica repetitivo depois de um tempo.

"DS","Infinite Space (Mugen Kōro), initially announced as Infinite Line, is a science fiction role-playing video game with space simulation and real-time strategy RPG elements, developed by Nude Maker and Platinum Games for the Nintendo DS. It was the third of a four game publishing deal with Sega. It was released in Japan on June 11, 2009, North America on March 16, 2010, and Europe on March 26, 2010.
A series of short films were also produced by anime studios Gonzo and Production I.G to promote the game, premiering at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.

Gameplay

A battle sequence. The player’s ship is shown in the center of the top screen, while controls are displayed below.
Infinite Space is a science fiction role-playing video game that allows the player to design and control a spaceship. The player can customize the ship with over 150 different design models, along with over 150 possible crewmembers. After customizing a ship, the player can explore an expansive game world with a story spanning two galaxies. Characters seen in the game are displayed in 2D, while ships, exploration, and battles are in 3D.
The entire game is controlled by the touchscreen. Neither characters nor spacecraft are controlled directly, but rather, are controlled in a ”point and click” type manner. Travel is done by first choosing a destination, then engaging the engines to move towards that destination. Spaceship battles occur in real-time, with attacks utilizing a ”command gauge” feature. As the command gauge builds up, the player can use it to perform attacks against an enemy ship. The rate at which the command gauge fills depends on the type of ship, and the crew of the ship.
When the player boards an enemy ship, the player takes control of their character to move through the ship. Characters aren’t moved directly, but rather by selecting commands, such as ”move right”. Melee battles are fought too, using a system similar to ”rock, paper, scissors”, and a command gauge that is similar to the one used in spaceship battles.
Multiplayer spaceship battles are also available for two-players to play competitively over local Wi-Fi. The game also features a non-linear branching narrative, with numerous choices that can have dramatic consequences. The game needs to be played multiple times in order to see the different possible paths in the narrative, which is helped by a New Game+ mode that is unlocked after completing the game for the first time.

Reception

Reception for the game has been generally positive. Japan’s Famitsu magazine rated it 9/9/8/8 for a total of 34 points, earning it a Gold award. Famitsu applauded the large volume of the game, along with its extensive customization and intricate story. While some famitsu reviewers liked this, others were overwhelmed by the amount of detail, and the steep learning curve.
Among Western critics, Infinite Space reveived aggregate ratings of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, and 8.0 out of 10 on GameStats. IGN gave it a score of 7 out of 10, stating that the game had an ”epic story”, but that the steep learning curve and clunky interface would test player’s patience in being able to get to the good parts of it. GamesRadar had a similar view, praising the multifaceted story, but complaining about interface problems, such as how the player can customize the ship, but cannot directly see how different parts affect the ships statistics while actually doing the building itself. Overall, GamesRadar gave it a score of 9 out of 10, concluding that what it ”lacks in the soft approachability of a Pokemon or Mario RPG, it makes up for in bombastic scale and mettle. Hundreds of planets. Hundreds of interesting, fully formed characters. Hundreds of lasers, mess halls and intergalactic toilets to equip. Infinite Space feels like proper grown-up gaming and a proper grown-up journey. Our hero grows from man to boy, and the DS matures with him.”
RPGFan gave it a glowing review, giving it a 92% score, and stating, ”There truly is a grand sense of time and space in this game; it is a long story told across multiple galaxies and dozens of star systems. It is that rare RPG that genuinely makes you feel like the fate of the whole universe is at stake and is actually worthy of its grandiose name. Easily on par with anything you’ll find in Xenosaga or Mass Effect, this is not just good science fiction, but a space opera for the ages.” RPGamer gave it a score of 4 out of 5, noting that the ”narrative features numerous choices to make, some of which have dramatic consequences,” and concluding that ”the game’s battles are entertaining, the story is one of the most gripping in video games, the subject matter is unique, and the rewards for exploration and customization are plentiful. These qualities are plenty to make it one of the DS’s top RPGs.”
Sales
During the first week following its release in Japan, Infinite Space sold 38,000 units and was the highest selling game in Japan during that period. Sales tracking company Media Create predicted that the game would have a 92% sell-through rate, indicating that it could continue to perform well on the market.","Sega","No","Infinite Space","","","T","Role Playing Game, Simulation, Strategy","","7.0","2010-03-16","Sega","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","$11.00","$11.00","2013-07-12","","","010086670288","1013753","2019-01-03 20:58:26",Collection
"Xbox 360","Infinite Undiscovery (インフィニット アンディスカバリー Infinitto Andisukabarī) is an action role-playing video game developed by tri-Ace and published by Square Enix exclusively for the Xbox 360. The game was released during September 2008 in Europe, Japan, and North America.

Infinite Undiscovery was announced in September 2006 by Famitsu.[7] Initially it was believed that Microsoft would publish the game,[8] however at TGS 2007, Hajime Kojima and Hiroshi Ogawa stated that Square Enix took over publishing duties because they have more ”know-how” with RPGs.[9] However, since Microsoft was the original publisher, it holds the trademark for the game[10] and shares the copyright with Square Enix.[11]

According to tri-Ace co-founder and R&D programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda, this game is set to contain 10 years worth of ideas that can finally be realized by the power of the Xbox 360 and that with it, ”RPGs will undergo a true evolution.”[12] tri-Ace wishes to achieve this by putting the player through ”situational battles” that will lead to ”unknown discoveries” and cause permanent changes to the world.

The game was directed by Hiroshi Ogawa and produced by Hajime Kojima, both of which are credited in the tri-Ace titles Star Ocean: Till the End of Time and Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth. tri-Ace president Yoshiharu Gotanda signed on as the game’s lead programmer. Scenario was handled by ORG Ltd., including Ryo Mizuno and Shoji Gatoh. The game’s characters were designed by Yukihiro Kajimoto.
 In Japan, Famitsu gave Infinite Undiscovery a total score of 32 out of 40 from four reviewers (9, 8, 8, 7). Abroad, Infinite Undiscovery has received mixed reviews from the critics, with an average of 68 on Metacritic and 69 on GameRankings. IGN gave it a 7.1 saying ”This isn’t a game marred with horrendous bugs or unplayable combat. And it’s not boring. It’s just misguided. The story is intriguing enough that RPG fanatics should at least give this a rental.” 1UP.com gave it a B saying ”Undiscovery is absolutely worth playing through at least once, with the regrettable caveat that it really could’ve been so much more.” GamePro gave it a 3 out of 5 saying ”In the end, Undiscovery isn’t a bad game but it is seriously flawed. I’d recommend renting it before you invest your hard earned cash on a purchase, especially if you’re new to the RPG genre.” GameSpot awarded the score of 6.5 (”Fair”) but felt it was too flawed to reach its potential. GamesRadar gave it a 7 out of 10 saying ”When it’s acting like a run-of-the-mill JRPG, it feels clichéd, but reasonably enjoyable. When it tries to be innovative, however, its unsatisfying combat, superfluous subsystems and wasted ensemble cast make the whole experience feel half-hearted.” X-Play gave the game a 4 out of 5, praising its addictive and fast paced action and multi-party battles, while criticizing its ”ridiculous” name, its annoying protagonist, and slow story line. X-Play explained that while the story is slow at the start of the game, once you push through for a few hours, the game and story are actually very entertaining.","Square Enix","No","Infinite Undiscovery","","","T","Role Playing Game","","7.1","2008-09-02","Tri-Ace","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","2","Colored Snap Case","1","$6.47","$6.47","2012-08-16","","","662248908120","899517","2019-01-03 15:06:37",Collection

"Wii","The Legend of Dragon é um jogo de luta baseado no desenho animado de mesmo nome. O título traz uma fórmula semelhante a jogos como Double Dragon ou Streets of Rage; é possível caminhar livremente pelo cenário entre os combates. As fases são todas baseadas na série de desenho animado, incluindo áreas como os 12 Templos Sagrados e o Dragon Dojo.

O jogador é colocado na pele de Ang Lueng, um lutador do Dragon Dojo que recebe o título de Dragão Dourado de seu mestre, Chin. No entanto, sua irmã gêmea, Ling, que sempre se destacou como a melhor lutadora, revoltou-se e deixou o Dojo, jurando vingança ao seu irmão e a todos que lá estavam. Seu ódio acabou levando-a a receber o título de Dragão das Sombras.

O título apresenta ao todo 18 personagens jogáveis — que ainda são capazes de se transformar —, além de oito modalidades diferentes para um jogador e três modos multiplayer.","The Game Factory","","Legend Of The Dragon","","","T","Fighting","","3.8","2007-01-05","Neko Entertainment","4","Canada","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$3.59","$3.59","2013-02-24","","","855433001649","1525520","2019-01-03 15:06:40",Collection

"Game Boy Color","Simultaneously released with Oracle of Ages, this second Capcom-developed Zelda game is widely regarded as the more difficult of the two adventures, Oracle of Ages sees Link embark on a similar quest to that in Oracle of Seasons, in that he must rescue a beautiful woman from the clutches of an unspeakable evil. Link’s adventure begins when he awakens in a strange forest deep within the land of Labrynna. By using the Harp of Ages, Link is able to transcend the very fabric of time, allowing him to jump between the past and present as the need arises.

"Game Boy Advance","The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past on Game Boy Advance is an identical port of the classic SNES game of the same name. What separates these brilliant Zelda adventures other than the Game Boy Advance’s version being portable is that the GBA version also includes a Capcom-developed multiplayer game entitled Four Swords.
In Four Swords, up to four players can play together for a mix of cooperation and competition, solving puzzles, gathering Rupees and trading items.

"Game Boy","This is the fourth game in the Zelda series although it does not take place in Hyrule. After being attacked at sea, Link’s ship sinks, and he finds himself stranded on Koholint Island. He awakens to see a beautiful woman looking down at him. He soon learns the island has a giant egg on top of a mountain that the Wind Fish inhabits deep inside. Link is told to ”awaken the wind fish and all will be answered,” so Link sets out on another quest.

Play is mostly similar to the SNES game with a top-down perspective. However, there are short sections in dungeons where the game switches to a side-scrolling view with platforming elements. Link must go onto each of the 7 temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, Link must search the land and uncover hidden treasures and items that will allow him to progress on his journey. With new items, he can open up new passages that will take him even farther on his quest and allow him to enter new areas that were inaccessible before. Link can attack his enemies with his sword or use items he finds during his quest to help him. Guarding every instrument is a temple boss, which must be defeated if Link is to awaken the Wind Fish.","Nintendo","","Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, The","","","E","Action","","10.0","1994-12-31","Nintendo","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Snap Case","1","","","","","","045496730857","1124371","2019-01-03 15:06:16",Collection

At the fringes of this peaceful existence, vicious demons have started to slowly invade, and there are few with power enough to know how to deal with this demon invasion. Players experience the world of Lunar as the human boy, Jian, and his group of friends. Jian’s story begins simply but quickly evolves as he and his friends unravel the evil plot being laid against Althena and discover that they alone can save Lunar from the forces of evil.","Ubisoft","No","Lunar: Dragon Song","","","E10+","Adventure, Role Playing Game","","6.3","2005-09-27","Japan Art Media","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Snap Case","1","","$7.60","2011-07-14","Used","Complete in Case","008888160380","1127429","2019-01-03 18:16:03",Collection

"3DS","Mario Golf: World Tour is a golf simulation video game with the basic premise mirrors the basis of golf. Controls characters from the Mario franchise, the player aims to hit a golf ball with a golf club across a golf course in order to hit it into the target hole in the lowest number of strokes. The game in particular employs an arcade-like approach to golf, emphasizing simple, straightforward controls and faster paced gameplay over realism. Despite this, some courses are modeled to look like real-life courses, while others are Super Mario themed environments. The game continues to employ the gameplay mechanic of ”Super Shots”; when chosen by the player, they allow for extra distance when hitting the ball, although only a limited number of them are allocated per course, creating a strategic aspect to their use.

The game also contains online multiplayer golf tournaments, as well as a feature to find other players to play golf with.","Nintendo","Yes","Mario Golf: World Tour","","","E","Sports","","8.6","2014-05-02","Nintendo","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","","","","Complete In Case","???","045496742447","1313551","2019-01-03 22:49:18",Collection

"3DS","¡La Federación Galáctica te necesita! En el año 20X6 del calendario cósmico, años después de la destrucción de Phazon y el mundo corrupto Phaaze por parte de la cazarrecompensas Samus Aran, la galaxia continúa llena de peligros por culpa de los piratas espaciales. Conviértete en recluta de la división de élite de la Federación Galáctica en Metroid Prime: Federation Force para Nintendo 3DS, un shooter en primera persona basado en el universo de la mítica serie Metroid de Nintendo. Súbete al exoesqueleto de combate meka, producto de la operación militar Gólem, y viaja al inhóspito sistema Bermuda e infíltrate en bases infestadas de enemigos, combate alienígenas en diversas misiones y resuelve puzles en solitario o con un pelotón de hasta cuatro soldados en modo local o en línea.

Únete a la primera línea de ataque contra los piratas espaciales y colabora con el resto de miembros de la Federation Force y apóyalos durante la batalla de diferentes formas, como reparando su salud o ralentizando al enemigo, y completa misiones para desbloquear nuevas opciones que harán de tu meka incluso más poderoso. Pero un soldado de élite no sólo debe liarse a tiros contra piratas espaciales. Las necesidades de la Federación Galáctica implican misiones de alto riesgo, como recuperar información secreta o capturar seres extremadamente peligrosos, que te llevarán a multitud de escenarios dentro del sistema Bermuda como olvidadas ruinas o entornos helados.

Y cuando la galaxia te permita un descanso, perfecciona tu dominio del meka en Blast Ball, el deporte competitivo por equipos de la Federation Force en el que podrás librar partidos de hasta seis jugadores online o junto a tus amigos en los que deberás introducir una bola en la portería enemiga mientras evitas que tus enemigos, o los golpes contra el propio balón, te dejen sin energía.

Características:
Aprovecha las opciones estratégicas de la pantalla táctil, en la que encontrarás listas de objetivos y mapas, además de instrucciones para tu pelotón. Si decides jugar acompañado en Federation Force la cooperación será esencial para abrir puertas, cubriros ante ataques enemigos o sortear obstáculos.
Reparte las funciones de cada soldado antes de una misión escogiendo entre municiones auxiliares que otorgarán diferentes responsabilidades. ¡Pero vigila siempre el límite de peso!
Mejora tu destreza en la zona de entrenamiento y supera récords en la galería de tiro o ponte a prueba en el simulador de combate contra hologramas de piratas espaciales.
Consulta el informe de fin de misión en el que se te asignará una puntuación basada en la rapidez y en los objetivos cumplidos para conseguir medallas que desbloquearán nuevos diseños para tu meka.
Compite en los trepidantes partidos de Blast Ball en multijugador online y local o en solitario con la consola controlando al resto de integrantes de los dos equipos.
Personaliza tu meka gracias a la compatibilidad con figuras Amiibo, que desbloquearán diseños exclusivos o te proporcionarán ventajas especiales.","Nintendo","Yes","Metroid Prime: Federation Force","","","T","First Person Shooter","","5.9","2016-08-19","Next Level Games","4","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","","$10.99","2018-12-29","Complete In Case","GameStop - Westwood Vista","045496743888","1446702","2019-01-03 22:38:03",Collection

"3DS","Monsters? Don’t hide… Ride!

When a monster strikes, the fearful hide, but the brave? They ride. Venture into monster nests to collect eggs and hatch a wide array of species with uniquely powerful skills. Form teams, battle alongside them, crush opponents with combo attacks, and ride into the sunset a champion. Need more muscle? Then mix and match genes to create monsters with more abilities!

When a monster infected by the Black Blight attacks your remote village of riders, tragedy will thrust you into an exciting yet dangerous world, where you must bond with monsters on your adventure. As the story snakes along, you’ll encounter a wealth of side quests and hours of challenging turn-based battles where you must coordinate monster skills, rider skills and enemy attack patterns. The instinctive rock-paper-scissors combat system is a series first, a breath of fresh air for veterans and newcomers alike. It’s the perfect entry point into the popular Monster Hunter universe and a game unlike anything else in the series! You can even battle other players online, locally, or via the StreetPass™ feature!

"Sega Genesis","Ms. Pac-Man has 36 ways to drive you totally wild and crazy with more fun than you’ve ever imagined! She gets to run around in 36 unique, mind-boggling mazes! Some small ones, some so big you’ll have to scroll around. Some that are mighty strange and some that are straight out of the arcades! Whether you choose Easy, Normal, Hard or Crazy speeds, Ms. Pac-Man will have you running ragged! There’s even a Pac Booster button to really let her shake those pesky ghosts, play Ms. Pac-Man by yourself or take turns with a friend. Better yet, two can play at the same time - one as the divine Ms. Pac-Man; the other as the original Pac-Man!","Tengen","No","Ms. Pac-Man","","","E","Puzzle","","9","2000-12-31","Innerprise Software","2","Canada","Controller Game Pad","Cartridge","No","1","Thick Snap Case","1","","","","","","031763030508","978285","2019-01-03 15:05:59",Collection

"Xbox 360","Players will jump into the title role of the unyielding Nier as he begins his desperate quest to discover a cure for his daughter, Yonah, who is stricken with the deadly Black Scrawl disease. Armed with a powerful set of magical abilities as well as mighty swords and armor, Nier will do battle alongside a set of formidable allies against waves of dark enemies and giant bosses to discover the truth about the disease, his daughter...and himself.

STORY

The game opens with a prologue during the summer of 2049 during which it is, unusually, snowing. In a modern but dilapidated-looking city, a silver-haired man fends off attacks from ethereal monsters in and around a broken-down grocery store where he is sheltering with his sick daughter, Yonah. Having defeated the last of the monsters, he checks on Yonah, who has begun to cough much worse than before. The man then realizes that Yonah has activated the magical book they carried, against his wishes. Realising this may be fatal for her, he calls out for help, but to no avail.

The game then cuts to 1,312 years later, where the player sees what appears to be the same two characters-the man, named Nier, and his sick daughter Yonah-now living in a thriving village led by twins Devola and Popola, and built upon the ruins of an old town and library. The human population has dwindled, and civilization has reverted to a much simpler form, congregating in villages and working together to protect themselves from the monsters, known to the people as ”Shades”. Fearing that his daughter’s illness is terminal, Nier sets out to look for a cure.

Upon searching a tower-like shrine nearby, Nier stumbles upon a talking book, calling itself Grimoire Weiss, which suggests that the two team up to defeat the army of Shades that appears. This partnership allows Nier to use magic, and the two begin their quest to search the lands to collect all the Sealed Verses that Nier hopes will allow Weiss to heal his daughter. In their search they encounter the hot-tempered, foul-mouthed Kain’e, who herself is part-Shade, and a young boy Emil, whose eyes petrify anyone that gazes upon them. Their quest sees many hardships, culminating in Kain’e becoming petrified in order to seal in a deadly Shade, while Yonah is carried away by the master Shade-the Shadowlord-who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.

Five years later, Emil believes he has discovered the key to removing his curse as well as unpetrifying Kain’e, and he and Nier journey to a lab below Emil’s mansion, where Emil remembers his past: he and his sister were the subjects of experiments into weapons research being conducted under the mansion as part of the ”Gestalt Project”. His sister, codenamed ”Number 6”, was utilised to create the ”ultimate weapon”, while he, ”Number 7”, was kept in reserve. In becoming the ultimate weapon, his sister was transformed into a large, disfigured skeleton-like creature; having returned to life, she is ultimately defeated by Nier, while Emil attempts to seal away her power. This has the unfortunate side-effect of transforming a devastated Emil into his sister’s skeleton-like body that floats above the ground; however, he also regains his sight and gains new magic, including the ability to remove petrification. After unpetrifying Kain’e and defeating the shade they had sealed in, the three set out to find the parts to a key that they believe will help them locate the Shadowlord and Grimoire Noir.

With the pieces in place, the team return to the tower where Weiss was originally found, in order to defeat the Shadowlord; Emil sacrifices himself so that Nier and Kain’e can continue. In the Shadowlord’s tower, Devola and Popola reveal to them that all of the remaining humans on the planet are not truly human, but are Replicants from the Gestalt Project. Faced with its own destruction over 1,300 years ago by a virus, mankind created the Gestalt Project in an attempt to overcome the virus by transferring their minds and souls into duplicate shells- Replicants-created from their genes and free of disease, via an intermediary ”Gestalt” form that held their souls. The project was initially successful, with humans transformed into Gestalt form and corresponding Replicants made in anticipation of their transferral, but the Replicants began to exert their own consciousness, gradually becoming human entities of their own without the original owner’s souls transferred into them, while the Gestalt transformation process began showing signs of errors when Gestalt forms began to ”relapse”-losing sentience and attacking Replicants. The Shades that Nier and the people have been fighting are actually the many Gestalt forms of the original humans, their aggressiveness due to relapse, an overwhelming desire to return to real bodies, and as revenge for the killing of the many Shades by these humans. The team defeat Devola and Popola, who are androids created as part of the Gestalt Project to assist with the transferral process, and have been waiting for the reunification of Grimoire Noir and Grimoire Weiss, an act which would seal the Gestalts into their Replicant bodies.

Nier, Kain’e and Weiss finally defeat the Shadowlord and his Grimoire Noir, and discover that the Shadowlord is actually the original ”Nier” that was seen in the game’s prologue. Driven by an identical desire to protect his daughter, he sacrificed himself and became a Gestalt in order that he could fend off the monsters attacking them, and became the first ever sentient Gestalt in the process. Now, having taken Yonah from Nier, he has given the original human Yonah-who originally became a Gestalt accidentally at the end of the prologue, and soon after relapsed-her Replicant body, but this Yonah realises that she cannot keep it, as she hears the Replicant Yonah calling for her father. She vacates the body, and Nier and Yonah are reunited.

Subsequent playthroughs reveal additional information from the perspective of the Shades, while a book accompanying the game, ”Grimoire Nier”, released in Japan, adds further information to events after the game’s conclusion. The book indicates that the Shadowlord, as the first sentient Gestalt, was connected to all other Shades, and that Nier’s slaying of the Shadowlord will cause the decline of all Gestalt forms (Shades) in the near future. As Replicants are unable to reproduce and must be recreated from their Gestalt forms, it is also suggested that the Replicant population will begin its decline as well, and thus Nier has inadvertently set into motion the end of humanity. However, it should be noted that in the final ending, Nier can sacrifice his very existence to save Kaine. The contractor for this revival, Tyrann (who is also the Shade inhabiting Kaine), claims that the sacrifice will transform her into a regular human being. Another ending also shows that Emil did not die, instead losing his body and seemingly continuing his existence as the ”head” of the weaponis","Square Enix","No","Nier","","","M","Action, Role Playing Game","","7.0","2010-04-27","Square Enix","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","","","","","","662248909097","985481","2019-01-03 15:05:59",Collection

"Wii U","Ninja Gaiden 3 offers for the first time a look at the world through Hayabusa’s eyes, showing what drives him to fight, and kill. At the center of the conflict this time around is a masked man whose motivations and goals are unclear. Through mysterious powers, he changes Hayabusa -- and the lines between hero and villain, good and evil, are blurred forever.
Featuring a new story, new gameplay and new modes, Ninja Gaiden 3 marks a new direction in this fan-favorite franchise. Team Ninja aims to change the way fans think about ninja and Hayabusa in this game, and promise that they’ll know what it feels like to ”cut someone down” through their experiences in the game.
And in this ”Razor’s Edge” recut of the game, the female ninja Ayane joins the battle as a new playable character in her own exclusive chapters within story mode. With more weapons and Ninpo types, a new character progression system, a redesigned battle system, a new character, two-player online co-op game play using Ryu and Ayane, and the return of dismemberment, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor’s Edge improves upon the original Ninja Gaiden 3 in every way and offers Wii U exclusive features and functionalities.","Nintendo","No","Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor’s Edge","","","M","Action, Hack n’ Slash","","7.6","2012-11-18","Team Ninja","1","United States","Touch Screen","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","","","","Sealed In Case","???","045496902964","1258794","2019-01-03 15:07:16",Collection

"Wii","No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle (ノーモア★ヒーローズ 2: デスパレート・ストラグル Nōmoa★hīrōzu 2: Desuparēto sutoraguru) is an action video game developed for the Wii video game system. It is the sequel to No More Heroes. It was directed by Suda51, developed by Grasshopper Manufacture, published by Ubisoft and Rising Star Games, and was released on January 26, 2010 in North America, on May 28, 2010 in Europe, and in Japan on October 21, 2010.

Development

Desperate Struggle was announced on October 8, 2008, where a teaser trailer for the game was shown at the Tokyo Game Show in Chiba, Japan. The trailer provides little insight to the premise of the game, other than that the player will once again take control of Travis Touchdown, the protagonist from the first game. Following No More Heroes’ suit of pitting Travis against unique adversaries, the trailer sees Travis preparing to battle a woman fitted with a six-limbed jet pack. It has been stated that this time around, Travis is fighting for revenge, and that he has also become more serious about fighting than he was in the first title.Also, similar to the first game’s numerous references to popular culture, in the trailer Travis says the Terminator series’ catch phrase ”I’ll be back!” before initiating a sequence with music similar to that of the Terminator series’ scores.
Plans for a No More Heroes sequel were first revealed shortly after the release of the first game, in a March 15, 2008 interview with Computer and Video Games, where Suda revealed he would be interested in producing a No More Heroes 2 for the Wii, on the condition that the game sold well enough to convince its publishers. With No More Heroes’ positive reception in North America, and Martin Defries, manager of Rising Star Games who were responsible for publishing No More Heroes in Europe, raving about the sales of the first game, not only was it unlikely that Suda’s intention to direct a follow-up would go unsupported, but this meant it was likely that the sequel would not be published exclusively in Japan. Release dates for Desperate Struggle in North America and Europe have been confirmed. It was announced at TGS 2008 that Xseed Games would publish the game in North America, taking over from Ubisoft which had published the North American release of No More Heroes, while Rising Star Games would again handle the European release. Ubisoft, however, announced at E3 2009 that they would be publishing the game in North America.
Suda has stated that the game incorporates a strong theme of revenge. While he suggested the game would be more serious, he still wanted to maintain the game’s sense of humor. He has also acknowledged the criticism that was made that the open world in the first game was less than satisfying, and hopes to add more detail this time around.

Reception
 
No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle has been met with generally favorable reviews, receiving a score of 84/100 on Metacritic.
IGN praised the game for its quirky sense of humor, stream-lined design of the play experience, numerous pop-culture references, humorous sexual innuendo, 8-bit minigames and impressive graphics. Game Informer praised the new side-jobs and action while criticizing the repetitive voice work and occasionally rough graphics. X-Play stated that, while the navigation and minigames have improved, the story can be inconsistent in later missions and some bosses are frustrating. GameSpot called the combat system ”remarkably fun and interactive” and commended the game’s ”excellent use of motion controls.” Jonathan Holmes of Destructoid stated ”It’s extremely well crafted from beginning to end, and rarely (if ever) sacrifices fun for delivering a message.” GameZone’s Caleb Newby stated that ”Desperate Struggle is so unpredictable it’s like the punch line to a parody of Japanese pop culture. Frantic and all over the map, it somehow makes it all work and gives Wii owners an amazing game for an older audience – a rare treat to find on Nintendo’s console.”
Sales of No More Heroes 2 have been relatively poor. According to Electronic Entertainment Design and Research (EEDAR), the game sold less than 30,000 units in its first week of release in North America. Desperate Struggle debuted on the UK charts at number five during its release week in that region. The game was the 13th best-selling game in Japan during its release week at 11,373 copies sold. According to Famitsu sales data, the game sold just 16,838 copies by the end of 2010. This total was less than that of either the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 versions of No More Heroes: Heroes’ Paradise, a remake of the original No More Heroes.
Future
In a 2009 interview with Kotaku, Suda51 stated he had no intentions of doing a sequel, but he had a change of heart due to the strong sales of the original. ”I originally didn’t want to make another No More Heroes,” he said, ”The game was supposed to be a one off dealio, but when the title did well, sequels do happen.” Suda51 announced that No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle would be the last No More Heroes game on the Wii. He was quoted by saying ”I think this is the last [No More Heroes] that is going to be developed on Wii. To expand [No More Heroes] to new possibilities, we need a new platform. Wii is a great platform, but we’ve done everything we can with it now.” He has since clarified this statement, stating that he intends to continue No More Heroes on the next Nintendo system, likely with a protagonist who is not Travis Touchdown. ”I’ve finished the story for Travis [Touchdown]. It’s completely finished in No More Heroes 2.” Anything developed will involve ”a different character, or something like that within the series.”
In March 2011, Suda51 expressed his desire to create a third game in the No More Heroes series. After the reveal of the Wii U in June of that year, Suda51 stated that he has all sorts of ideas for a third No More Heroes for the new platform. In July 2011, Suda51 announced a new No More Heroes game exclusively for mobile phones on the DeNA service. He promises to make the game extremely violent and hopes the game will be released in the West. He also states that he hopes the game is successful since he has ”over 100 concepts for mobile games.”","Ubisoft","No","No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle","","","M","Hack n’ Slash, Sandbox","","8.8","2010-01-26","Grasshopper Manufacture","1","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$8.99","$8.99","2013-07-13","","","008888175605","1172487","2019-01-03 15:06:53",Collection

"Wii","Onechanbara: Bikini Zombie Slayers (お姉チャンバラ Revolution OneeChanbara: Reboryūshon) is the Wii-exclusive sequel to Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad and the fourth main installment in the OneeChanbara video game series. It was released on February 7, 2008 in Japan and on February 10, 2009 in North America by Tamsoft and D3 as the first game in the OneChanbara series to be released for the Nintendo system. The game features elements from campy exploitation horror films, with equal amounts of bloody violence and exposed female flesh all played up to an intentionally ridiculous level.

Characters:

All playable characters are the same as the bosses and each one lasts eight stages.

Aya: Raised by her now-deceased father and trained by the sword, Aya has done her best to lead a normal life with her half-sister Saki yet been sometimes feeling a little bit insecure about her family’s ”Baneful Blood” curse, which has a tendency of sending her into berserk frenzies. Her alt-attack mode has her wielding two swords at once, which furthers the potency of her standard sword-fighting techniques.

Saki: Aya’s younger half-sister and descended from the same cursed bloodline, Saki has fully recovered from wounds sustained during the events of OneChanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad but harbours as much worries about the ”Baneful Blood” curse as her older sister does. Her alt-attack mode is focused on single-target hand-to-hand attacks with extreme lethality and precision.

Reiko: One of the nine ”Single Digit” clones of Reiko Mizusaki (No.1–9; all subsequent mass-production clones were based on the Single Digits instead of the original Reiko), she is capable of the full range of investigative tasks from intelligence gathering to self-defense combat and is telepathically linked to all other Single Digits and the original Reiko; in addition, she is genetically modified to duplicate what is essentially Humanity’s understanding of the Baneful Blood descendants. Her story arc paints both the original Reiko and her clones in a more positive light, stating that despite extreme methods that have put her clones in conflict with Aya and Saki, Reiko’s true aim is not only to wipe out the undeads but also to prevent the possibility that Baneful Blood descendants can turn on the living afterward. Reiko No.9 possesses an alt-attack mode that grants her the use of firearms and comes equipped with a shotgun and a submachine gun. She is unlocked by completing story mode using Aya.

Misery: Being revived by power left behind by Himiko (the nemesis of Aya and Saki in OneChanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad), this yet another descendant of the ”Baneful Blood” is now only interested in exacting vengeance upon Aya and Saki. Her alt-attack mode has her sword transformed into a whip sword, granting it a far longer reach. She is unlocked by completing story mode using Saki.","D3 Publisher","No","Onechanbara: Bikini Zombie Slayers","Onechanbara","","M","Hack n’ Slash","","69","2009-02-10","Tamsoft","1-2","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","","1","Colored Snap Case","1","","","","Complete In Case","","879278340053","1574246","2023-09-30 14:28:17",Collection

"Xbox 360","Controlling a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord’s Dark Tower. Only the player’s actions determine if they will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; it’s all down to how much of a bad ass they want to be in order to succeed... evil or really evil! Played out with plenty of black humour and dark irony, the game immerses players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters. Overlord’s key innovation is the introduction of an array of impish creatures – the Minions. They believe you are the old Overlord reborn and will use their unique skills to fetch, fight and die for you. Throughout the game players actively control a horde of these gremlin-like critters and they follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is.","Codemasters","No","Overlord","","","T","Action, Real Time Strategy, Role Playing Game","","8.0","2007-06-29","Triumph Studios","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$6.29","$6.29","2013-03-15","","","767649401529","908960","2019-01-03 15:06:45",Collection

"3DS","Paper Mario: Sticker Star is a 2012 role-playing video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS console. It is the fourth installment of the Paper Mario series and is the first game in the series playable on a handheld console. The game was released in North America on November 11, 2012 and in December 2012 in both Japan and Europe.

Like previous Paper Mario games, Paper Mario: Sticker Star uses a papercraft visual style that is heavily incorporated into its gameplay mechanics. Sticker Star introduces the use of stickers, which are littered throughout the game world and are used as items or power-ups, aiding the player in turn-based battles against enemies or in solving puzzles. The plot follows Mario’s quest to gather the six Royal Stickers that were scattered by Bowser.","Nintendo","Yes","Paper Mario: Sticker Star","","","E","Adventure, Platform, Role Playing Game","","8.3","2012-11-11","Intelligent Systems","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Snap Case","1","$29.99","$29.99","2012-11-11","","","045496742133","1244358","2019-01-03 22:49:59",Collection
"Gamecube","GameCube sequel to the unique 2.5D role-playing game for N64. Known as Paper Mario RPG in Japan (the original was called Mario Story), Paper Mario 2 combines turn-based battles with action elements. You select commands from a command ring atop your characters’ heads, such as jumping or swinging a hammer, then have to time yourself just right to defend or pull off maximum damage. Throughout their adventure, Mario and friends find help in a few items and places. You can heal your party at an inn and purchase items at a shop, collect coins by defeating enemies, and buy new special abilities in a badge shop.

"Xbox 360","Phantasy Star Universe (ファンタシースターユニバース Fantashī Sutā Yunibāsu) (PSU) is an action roleplaying game by Sega’s Sonic Team for the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. In Japan, it was released for the PC and PlayStation 2 on August 31, 2006, with the Xbox 360 version releasing on December 12, 2006. Its North American release was on October 24, 2006, available in all formats. The European release date was November 24. The initial unveiling of the game was at E3 2004, with subsequent showing at the next E3, and then again at TGS 2005. A closed beta stress test for the servers took place between April and May 2006.
While Phantasy Star Universe is a hack and slash roleplaying game similar to the Phantasy Star Online (PSO) games, it takes place in a (presumably) different time period and location and has many new features. Like most of the PSO titles, PSU is playable in both a persistent online network mode and a full featured single-player story mode.

Reception

Erik Brudvig of IGN gave Phantasy Star Universe a passable score of 6.4 out of 10, saying ”The result is an unsatisfying and stale experience that feels like an update to an old game that has had its day rather than a new title.” James Mielke of 1up gave an average rating of ”B+” gave the game a 68 out of 100.","Sega","No","Phantasy Star Universe","","","T","Action, Role Playing Game","","6.4","2006-11-26","Sonic Team","6","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$8.99","$8.99","2013-02-22","","","010086680089","957251","2019-01-03 15:06:38",Collection

"3DS","There’s a whole lot of stuff to do during the last week of summer vacation and Phineas and Ferb want to do it all! Join these charismatic brothers of invention as they create, travel and explore in their quest for artifacts to fill out the Museum of Cool. Perry the pet platypus, aka Agent P, has their backs when bumbling villain Dr. Doofenshmirtz unleashes his latest obscure ”-inator” devices designed to take over the entire Tri-State area!

 Play as Phineas, Ferb and Perry/Agent P as you interact with characters from the show including Dr. Doofenshmirtz, Candace, Isabella, Buford and Baljeet.
 Experience two unique play mechanics: Exploration Mode: Switch on-the-fly between ambitious innovator Phineas and silent, but stoic ”Man of Action” Ferb as you explore their backyard, a lost temple, underwater caverns, and the surface of the moon! Action Mode: Transform Perry from subdued pet mode to super Agent P--jump, run, crouch, slide, hang from ledges, fight robot ”inators” and sneak past traps and obstacles in Doofenshmirtz’s diabolical lab.
 Build and play in the A.T.T. (All-Terrain Transformatron Vehicle). Upgrade the A.T.T. by assembling new parts like pincers, drills, rocket boosters and headlights that you need to access new areas. Customize the A.T.T to your preference with colors, sounds and decorative parts.
 Unfold an intertwining multi-episode storyline as Phineas and Ferb hunt for lost treasure and travel the world while crime-fighting Agent P embarks on a secret mission to foil Dr. Doofenshmirtz’s zany schemes.
 Defeat Dr. Doofenshmirtz’s flying Norm Bots and robot hordes including the Patroller, Jumper, Charger and other ”get-rid-of-cool-stuff-inators.” Avoid Dr. Doofenshmirtz’s nasty lab traps: collapsing floors, laser beams and falling boulders!
 Collect silver sprockets then use them to buy spare parts for the A.T.T.
 Swing by Phineas and Ferb’s backyard Museum of Cool to access special items and loot you’ve collected on your adventures. Ferb’s Amazing Fun Trinkets include some of the coolest artifacts the boys discover including the lost Atlantis hieroglyph, floating baby head, Meap’s Mustache, caveman’s first stone wheel, and more.","Majesco Entertainment","No","Phineas & Ferb: Quest For Cool Stuff","","","E","Adventure","","8.8","2014-03-07","Disney","1-2","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","","","Snap Case","1","","$7.99","2019-12-29","Maybe Missing Manual","Game Over - Bandera","096427018032","1414089","2020-01-26 20:39:57",Collection

"DS","Players star as a defense attorney, who must prove a seemingly guilty client’s innocence no matter how dire the circumstances may seem. Phoenix faces the toughest prosecutor yet as the mysterious hard-boiled ”Godot” tries to take him down at any cost. Players must collect evidence, survey crime scenes, weed through inconsistent testimonies, and overcome corrupt agendas to ensure that justice prevails. With the return of the popular ”psyche-lock” interrogation tool from the previous title, ”Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Justice for All,” players have to overcome even more intense courtroom standoffs in order to close the case. Maya Fey is a bright young girl that aids Phoenix in his trials; she harnesses her psychic powers which are useful in a pinch. Godot - the mysterious, hard-boiled prosecutor makes his appearance. Play as two lawyers - relive Mia’s rookie days from the past and Phoenix’s current cases in the present. Two distinct gameplay segments: Investigation phase - survey crime scenes, interview witnesses and gather evidence that will be used in court; Court phase - present findings from the investigation to support your case, listen to testimonies and examine witnesses. ”Psyche-Lock” system - break down tough witnesses with a series of correct questions or catch them","Capcom","No","Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations","","","T","Puzzle, Strategy","","8.7","2007-10-23","Capcom","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","$7.00","$7.00","2011-12-02","Used","Complete in Case

"Wii","Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced ”Magna-Save” and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.","Crave Entertainment","No","Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection","","","E10+","Simulation, Compilation","","85","2008-02-26","Crave Entertainment","4","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","CD ROM","","1","Snap Case","1","","","","Complete In Case","","650008400014","1548746","2023-09-30 12:57:51",Collection

Pokemon Diamond and Pokemon Pearl offer a number of exciting new features to please both experienced and new Pokemon fans alike. Set in an entirely new region called ”Sinnoh,” players can choose to begin their adventure as either a boy or girl Pokemon trainer on a path to becoming Pokemon League Champion. The adventure continues as players can bring Pokemon from their Game Boy Advance Pokemon games to Pokemon Diamond and Pokemon Pearl using the GBA game slot on their Nintendo DS.

"DS","An additional chapter in the Pokemon franchise, expanding on the Pokemon Diamon/Pearl series with new elements to further enjoy the saga of Nintendo’s ”collect ’em all” RPG series. Much like Pokemon Yellow (Special Pikachu Edition), this version expands slightly on the series without being a full-blown sequel.
Pokemon Platinum features a new story full of adventure, never-before-seen forms of powerful Pokemon – including the legendary Giratina’s Origin Forme – and the Distortion World, a mysterious new world that suddenly appears in the Sinnoh region. In addition, with Pokemon Platinum up to 20 players can interact with other Pokemon fans from around the world in the new Wi-Fi Plaza, featuring mini-games and activities.","Nintendo","","Pokemon Platinum","","","E","Adventure, Role Playing Game","","8.8","2009-03-22","Game Freak","8","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Snap Case","1","$25.19","$25.19","2012-07-30","Used","Complete in Case","045496740177","1347260","2019-01-03 19:49:16",Collection

Sega published all the Japanese versions of the game; the game was scarcely released internationally, and versions of it were released by other publishers. North America only received the Nintendo GameCube and DS versions, whereas Europe received all domestic and major handheld versions. Sonic Team acquired the rights to develop the series from former publisher Compile, after they went bankrupt prior to the release of Sonic Team’s first Puyo Puyo game Puyo Pop.

"DS","Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords is a unique combination of classic RPG elements and fun puzzle mechanics. Create your own character and venture off in the world, listening to rumors, taking on quests, fighting monsters, and unraveling the mysteries to be found in the world of the Warlords. Designed specifically to entertain both casual and hardcore gamers with its deep immersion, five to fifteen minute play sessions and turn-based play style, Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords incorporates strategy, role-playing elements and a persistent storyline in a puzzle board setting.
Set in the Warlords universe, the game challenges players to create, develop and customize the ultimate hero in order to save the land of Etheria from evil Lord Bane. To advance their character, players battle in turn-based, head-to-head ”match-three” style puzzle games in one of three distinct gameplay modes. Single-player allows gamers to battle against the AI as they embark on over 150 challenging quests. Instant Action allows gamers to jump in and immediately play continuous battles to level-up characters without participating in quests. Multiplayer allows gamers to battle live opponents -- victory will advance the player’s hero, magical arsenal, creature companions and more, ultimately rewarding gamers at nearly every turn.","D3 Publisher","No","Puzzle Quest: Challenge of The Warlords","","","E10+","Puzzle, Role Playing Game","","8.9","2007-03-20","D3 Publisher","2","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","","","Snap Case","1","","$6.47","2020-01-24","Used","Complete in Case

"NES","Rad Racer is an arcade style 3-D racing game. The object of the game is to race to the goal within the given time limit. Along each course are several checkpoints which will increase the amount of time you have to reach the final destination. There are eight different stages with increasingly difficult roads, changing weather conditions, and a variety of opponents who tend to get in the way. Included with the game is an optional pair of red-blue 3-D glasses which can be used to give the game an even more 3-D appearance.","Nintendo","","Rad Racer","","","","Racing","","","1969-12-31","Square","","United States","Controller Game Pad","Cartridge","","","Cardboard Box","1","","","","","","nocode20110421203938756","1010042","2019-01-03 15:06:01",Collection
"DS","Radiant Historia (Rajianto Hisutoria) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Atlus for the Nintendo DS. The game’s development team mostly consists of Atlus staff who previously worked on Megami Tensei games like Nocturne, Persona 3 and Strange Journey as well as the Etrian Odyssey series. The development team also includes other members who had previously worked on Radiata Stories. The game was released on November 3, 2010 in Japan, and in North America on February 22, 2011.

Gameplay

Time travel
The game gives a unique take on the concept of non-linear branching storylines, which it combines with the concepts of time travel and parallel universes, similar to the games Chrono Trigger, and Chrono Cross.. Radiant Historia takes it much further by giving players the freedom to travel backwards and forwards through a timeline to alter the course of history, with each of their choices and actions having a major impact on the timeline. The player can return to certain points in history and live through certain events again to make different choices and see different possible outcomes on the timeline.
The player will be using the ability to travel through time and space throughout the game. The player will be changing the past to create a “true” future, and the game has the player travel through time and space as the player switches between parallel worlds. The game has many possible parallel endings.

Combat

The enemies are visible on the fields before an engagement and the player may choose to fight or avoid them in open combat. A battle begins when the party comes into contact with the enemies, or if a story event initiates a confrontation.
The battle system makes use of a positioning system called the ’Grid System’. Enemies are placed on a 3 x 3 grid, with each enemy standing in a single slot, except for some large enemies spanning multiple slots. If the player attacks an enemy who is in a grid space near the attacking character, the enemy will incur greater damage. However, the player will also be open to greater damage.
Some attacks can move enemies around the grid, stacking them on the same slot until an enemy’s turn comes and consecutive attacks on this group of enemies hit all of them. Despite being a turn-based combat system each member of the party can switch turns with the others and even with enemies, giving more freedom to the player to perform combos and deal further damage to enemies, but having its risks too, as a party member who switches turns become more vulnerable until becoming able to move again.

Development

A Japanese trademark for the game’s name was known to have existed as far back as March 2010. At that point, nothing was known about the game except its name. It was not until July 2010 that an issue of Famitsu revealed it to be a role-playing game for the Nintendo DS that involved time-travel. It was later revealed to involve many staff members who have worked on the Shin Megami Tensei series, and members of tri-Ace, makers of the similarly named Radiata Stories.

Radiant Historia has received mostly positive critical reception. 1UP’s Jeremy Parish gave the game a B+ score, describing it is ”easily the most original of this month’s slate of RPGs” and an ”engaging role-playing game that deserves a chance”, while praising the game’s protagonist Stocke, saying ”while he does indeed come off as a stock character at first impression...he quickly develops into something much more interesting.” Shiva Stella of GameSpot praised the game’s time travel aspect, calling it ”exciting” and ”inventive”; she then concludes Radiant Historia is ”an innovative adventure that is sure to stand the test of time.”
IGN has given the game 8.5 out of 10, praising the game’s graphics, time travel aspect, innovative gameplay and involving story and music which they called ”beautiful”. Neal Chandran of RPGFan gave the game a score of 91%, describing it as ”one of the best Japanese RPGs I’ve played in years.” Jason Schreier of Wired gave the game a score of 9 stars out of 10, concluding ”Atlus has created the perfect blend of innovation and tradition.” Matt Peckham of PC World praised the game’s nonlinear multidimensional concept which allows the game to be played differently by travelling to a decision point and choosing another path, in contrast to ”BioWare-style head pats, where whatever you choose, the game plays out more or less as it would have anyway.” The non-linear time travel system of Radiant Historia has been compared to later RPGs such as the PlayStation Portable version of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together and more recently Final Fantasy XIII-2.
In IGN’s ”Best of 2011” awards, the game has been nominated for the ”Best 3DS/DS Story” and ”Best 3DS/DS Role-Playing Game” awards. Nintendo Life gave it an honourable mention for the Game of the Year award. RPGFan gave it the ”Best Traditional RPG” award (tied with The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky), while editor Neal Chandran chose it as his pick for the ”Best RPG” award. Game Informer gave it the ”Best Old-School Homage” award. Samantha Nelson of The A.V. Club chose it as her staff pick for Game of the Year. RPGamer chose the game as Third Place for the RPG of the Year award.
On February 10th, 2012, Atlus announced via the Atlus Faithful newsletter that due to exceptional demand, Radiant Historia will see a reprint, to be available in late March of the same year.","Atlus","","Radiant Historia","","","","Role Playing Game","","8,5","2011-02-22","Atlus","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","Yes","1","Snap Case","1","","$35.00","2021-06-01","Complete In Box","GameStop for game and Anibal for box and CD","730865400423","1054060","2019-01-03 21:11:53",Collection

"Wii","Red Steel é o primeiro jogo de tiro em primeira pessoa para o console de nova geração da Nintendo, lançado no mesmo dia da estréia oficial do videogame. A idéia é um encontro das artes antigas japonesas com a tecnologia moderna. Katanas convivem pacificamente com armas de fogo de alto calibre, enquanto o jogador imerge numa jogabilidade que só é possível através do controle do Wii.
A idéia do jogo é um enredo nipônico-americano. Scott Monroe é o personagem principal. Ele é noivo de Miyu Sato, filha de Isao Sato, um sujeito poderoso envolvido com a máfia. Em um hotel em Los Angeles, na Califórnia, Isao e Scott finalmente vão se conhecer. Uma gangue disfarça-se como staff do hotel e abre fogo pesado contra o quarto de Sato. Scott desespera-se e tenta ajudar, mas acaba caindo incosciente no chão. Ao acordar, afana a pistola do guarda-costas morto e vai ao encontro de Sato (que está ferido) no telhado.
Após uma série de reviravoltas, Sato acaba morto e Miyu é raptada. Cabe a Scott ir atrás do seu amor, perseguindo os bandidos nas metrópoles de LA e Tóquio. Naturalmente, é claro, organizações criminosas e gangues darão as caras para atrapalhar ainda mais a vida de Scott. Prepare-se para um jogo sujo: uma espada na mão, um ”três oitão” na outra e o cara já era!","Ubisoft","No","Red Steel","","","T","First Person Shooter","","6*0","2006-11-19","Ubisoft Paris","4","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$3.59","$3.59","2013-06-02","","","008888173243","1187180","2019-01-03 15:07:15",Collection

"Xbox 360","The world of Resonance of Fate is a dying one. Humankind has abused the planet to the point of making it inhospitable, and so the people have crafted a massive tower in which they can live safely. Now, after years of further abuse, that tower too is falling into disrepair. Sections have shut down and the machine that once sustained life is now turning it into monsters. This situation is one that is ripe for exploitation, and that’s exactly what a group known as the Cardinals has done. The upper class literally lives above their servants, while the poorest scrap together a living near the bottom of the tower.","Sega","No","Resonance of Fate","","","T","Role Playing Game","","7.0","2010-03-16","Tri-Ace","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$14.00","$14.00","2013-05-31","","","010086680393","946145","2019-01-03 15:06:49",Collection

"Xbox 360","Samurai Shodown Sen follows a young European girl named Suzu, rescued from a sinking ship off Japan’s coast, adopted by the Amori Clan and raised as Princess Suzu. A decade later she saves Takechiyo, a self-proclaimed master of martial arts, after his ship sinks and he ends up washed on the beach; soon after this chance meeting, the tables turn when Princess Suzu mysteriously disappears and Takechiyo pledges to find his missing rescuer.
Staying close to its roots, alongside Princess Suzu, Takechiyo and a host of new characters, a plethora of old favorites from the series have been faithfully incorporated, including Haohmaru, Galford, Hanzo Hattori, Nakoruru and Ukyo Tachibana- taking the warriors to over 20 in total. Players can become any one of these unique fighters via the Xbox LIVE online entertainment network, to battle friends to see who can reach the top of a worldwide online ranking system.","XSEED Games","","Samurai Shodown Sen","","","M","Fighting","","4.0","2010-03-30","SNK Playmore","2","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$8.99","$8.99","2013-06-02","","","853466001308","951928","2019-01-03 15:06:47",Collection

"3DS","Here’s a bit of helpful advice to all you criminal organizations out there: If you’re going to hatch an elaborate plot that involves kidnapping children, don’t kidnap children who have ninjas for parents. That was the big mistake that a group called Zeed made when it went after the offspring of the Oboro clan. Now Joe Musashi is on the hunt to rescue the young hostages and take out Zeed’s leaders, the Ring of Five. As you scour each stage, leave no children behind - Joe can’t proceed to the next level without freeing them all. With an unlimited supply of shuriken, his sharpened katana and his deadly fists and feet, Joe will show Zeed why you don’t mess with family.","Sega","Yes","Shinobi","","","T","Action, Platform, Side Scrolling","","7.5","2011-11-15","Griptonite","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","0","Snap Case","1","$10.00","$10.00","2012-04-20","","Amazon","010086611076","958446","2019-01-03 22:55:42",Collection

"DS","The Sonic the Hedgehog experience has always been a platform design that more focused on running blazingly fast through the environments. Sonic Rush adds a ”boost” element where players can now counterattack enemies waiting in off-screen blindspots. This boosting element is limited, and players will have to build up the power in order to use it, but when it’s in stock it becomes incredibly handy and almost necessary to utilize. The new design also introduces a very ”extreme games” style move system where players can pull off special moves to score additional points and to boost power. These moves can be pulled off with button and D-pad combinations while leaping in the air as well as grinding on some rails. And, of course, there’s the dual screen aspect. The development team use the two screens as one display to give more of a viewable area.","Sega","No","Sonic Rush","","","E","Action, Side Scrolling","","9","2005-11-15","Sonic Team","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","$7.00","$7.00","2011-08-08","Used","Complete in Case

"Wii","Sonic and the Secret Rings (ソニックと秘密のリング Sonikku to Himitsu no Ringu?) is a video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega as part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It was released exclusively for the Wii on February 20, 2007 in North America; March 2 in Europe; and March 15 in Japan. It is the first Sonic game for the console, released in place of an aborted attempt to port Sonic the Hedgehog. Secret Rings is a three-dimensional platform and action game whose plot follows the series’ main character, Sonic the Hedgehog, on a quest to stop an evil genie named the Erazor Djinn. In addition to the basic platforming gameplay of previous Sonic titles, Secret Rings uses a system of experience points and levels, as well as special moves that are unlocked via leveling up.

Producer Yojiro Ogawa conceived the game to tap into the Wii Remote’s capabilities. He chose the theme of Arabian Nights, using many elements of the stories in the game’s setting, characters, and Middle Eastern-influenced music. Sega changed the title of the game several times, settling on Sonic and the Secret Rings to tie in the theme of Arabian Nights. Upon release, Secret Rings was generally well-received, contrasted with its predecessors as ”definitely on the mend”.[1] Reviewers praised its visuals but criticized its controls and inconsistent difficulty. It sold 83,000 copies in its first month and continued to chart throughout the year. Sega released a sequel in March 2009, Sonic and the Black Knight; the two form what is known as the Storybook series.","Sega","No","Sonic and the Secret Rings","","","E","Adventure, Platform","","7.0","2007-02-20","Sonic Team","4","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$16.19","$16.19","2013-07-29","","","010086650020","1224432","2019-01-03 15:06:56",Collection

"DS","SpongeBob’s Boating Bash is a racing game made by Play THQ based on the TV series SpongeBob SquarePants. It features SpongeBob SquarePants characters and is the first SpongeBob racing game since Nicktoons Racing, and it is also the first SpongeBob game released by Firebrand Games for the Nintendo DS and ImPulse Games for the Wii. It is compatible with the Wii Wheel. The game features more than 100 different options to customize a boat, and features 4 player mode. Even though this is the racing genre, this game is more of a demolition derby.

Plot

At Mrs. Puff’s Boating School, it’s the last test of the year and SpongeBob fails it. Later, a man named Seamour Scales finds SpongeBob, and tricks him into his ”D.R.I.V.E.” (Destruction, Recklessness, Impairment, Velocity, Escape) classes. As you progress through the game, the player unlocks more people to sign up. After the final exams, SpongeBob gets his licence. But Mrs. Puff informs him it’s not real. Then, SpongeBob sees Seamour going into a truck, realizing that it was a scam. This leads to a final battle, in vehicles, which SpongeBob wins. He then decides to go to Mrs. Puff’s Boating School next year.

There are up to 14 challenges in 11 Game Types – that’s a whole lot of testing! Only some challenges and Game Types are available when you start the game; you unlock further challenges along the way. Once you have unlocked a Game Type, you can play it for points. Master the game and reap fame and glory with your name on the High Score Screen. The only thing better than making the High Score Screen is beating your friends; so hook up with your buddies for a live competition in head to head or party modes - but don’t buckle under the multiplayer pressure!

"Wii","STAR TREK: CONQUEST is a single-player game of galactic conquest featuring a blend of strategy and action set in The Next Generation era. Players take control of Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Cardassian, Dominion, and Breen forces and lead them in a campaign to control the galaxy, one planet at a time. Players must build and manage their growing empires in turn-based strategy, and then engage in all out starship combat in real-time action.

Strategically, players must effectively manage their limited resources to expand their empire. Players can decide how to best achieve objectives by managing fleets, admirals, building support structures, researching technology and engaging enemies in combat. Once battle is initiated, the game switches to a ship level tactical view allowing players to take direct command of their ships and engage in real-time combat.

Strategy game set in The Next Generation era
Planets held by Next Generation era races are set in a large galactic map, where turn-based strategy allows you to build and expand your empire.
Real-time Starship combat
Take direct control of any ship and experience intense action as you engage in real-time combat.
Resource Management
Wise spending on starbases, factories, research facilities, and starships determines success.
Six Playable Races
Choose to command the Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Cardassian, Dominion, or Breen race, each with their own unique set of strengths and weaknesses.","Bethesda Softworks","No","Star Trek: Conquest","","","3+","Action, Adventure, Simulation, Strategy, Flight Simulator","","6.8","2007-11-13","4J Studios","1","United Kingdom","Motion Sensing Remote","USB","","1","Snap Case","1","","","","Complete In Case","","093155126305","1065278","2023-09-30 12:53:33",Collection

The effect of each of these changes depends on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). Street Fighter II has a ”button combination” style of gameplay used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These include the ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a tight suplex.","Capcom","","Street Fighter II","","","T","Fighting","","9.0","1992-07-20","Capcom","2","United States","Controller Game Pad","Cartridge","No","0","","1","","","","","","nocode20110505001028990","932902","2019-01-03 15:05:56",Collection

This evil and outer space menace, Smithy, brings fear and treachery to the once-pleasant Mushroom Kingdom. Once Smithy crashes into the Star Road, he causes seven stars to be scattered throughout the land. Mario and his friends must recover the Seven Stars and repair the Star Road by making an epic journey to Bowser’s castle to confront the dreaded Smithy.

The game was developed by Konami and originally released in Japan through Konami themselves, then in North America through Konami’s Ultra Games imprint, followed by a release through the European equivalent, Palcom Software, in PAL regions.

This was the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game, and is based on the 1987 TV series, which was in its third season at the time of the game’s original release, although the art style more resembles the original comic series. The game was ported to various home computer platforms in 1990; the original NES version was ported to Nintendo’s PlayChoice-10 arcade system in 1991, and the Wii’s Virtual Console service in 2007.","Ubisoft","No","TMNT","","","E","Platform","","","1969-12-31","Ubisoft","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","","1","Snap Case","1","","$13.49","2019-12-29","Complete In Case","GameStop - Bandera Point","008888163411","1184398","2020-02-01 23:21:59",Collection

"3DS","Tales of the Abyss (テイルズ オブ ジ アビス Teiruzu obu ji Abisu) is a role-playing video game developed by Namco Tales Studio and published by Namco in Japan and Namco Bandai Games in North America. Tales of the Abyss’s characteristic genre name is The Meaning Of Birth RPG (「生まれた意味を知るRPG」。). It is the eighth mothership title in the Tales series, and was released for the PlayStation 2 on December 15, 2005 in Japan, celebrating the Tales series’ 10th anniversary, and on October 10, 2006 in North America. It features the Flex Range Linear Motion Battle System, which most resembles Tales of Symphonia’s. The character designs are by manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima. The game was scheduled to receive a port to the Nintendo 3DS on May 19, 2011, but Namco Bandai has announced that the port for that region has been delayed to June 30, 2011. Nintendo Power magazine has confirmed the 3DS port for a North American release. It was released on February 14, 2012 in North America and in Europe on November 25, 2011.
An anime adaptation of the game, developed by Sunrise, premiered on MBS in October 2008. The episodes were directed by Kenji Kodama and written by Akemi Omode.

Gameplay

The game’s ”Flex Range Linear Motion Battle System” (FR-LMBS) is real-time. The game controls are very similar to other Tales games, especially Tales of Symphonia, except with increased maneuverability. The player can attack, defend, perform a skill or call up a menu with multiple functions, such as using items or commanding an ally to perform an action. This system offers multiplayer co-op battles, and the camera for this mode is improved over the one found in Tales of Symphonia, zooming out as characters move away from each other so that other players are now always on screen. A new feature, ”Free Run,” allows the player character to run in any direction, unlike previous Tales games.
The game features many skills and spells to unleash upon enemies. Characters can learn ”AD Skills,” which can be equipped and unequipped at will, to help them in battles. The game features a large number of these skills, acquired through the use of ”Capacity Cores” — items that give stat bonuses when a character levels up. Once a certain statistic has a large enough bonus, the AD skill is learned automatically. A new addition to the system is the ”Field of Fonons” (often abbreviated as FOF). Whenever a character uses a spell or battle technique that features an elemental alignment, a circle will appear on the ground, corresponding to that element. After being reinforced with more techniques of the same element, the circle will light up in that element’s color to signify that an FOF change is available. Finally, if a character stands in the circle and performs a specific skill that corresponds with the FOF circle, the skill will be upgraded into a more powerful version. Enemies can also use and create FOF fields. As with other Tales games, characters can engage in ”Over Limit” mode when their green OVL bar is full. This can be filled by completing combos and making critical hits. During Over Limit, characters can use their Mystic Artes (Hi-Ougis), powerful skills that can only be performed when certain conditions are fulfilled. Every character has one standard Mystic Arte, along with an additional hidden one unlockable only on repeat plays. Enemy boss characters have Mystic Artes as well.
Recurring features
Many recurring features in the Tales series return, such as skits, grade, cooking, and titles.
Skits are short conversations that may be viewed when prompted. During a skit, anime-style faces of the characters taking part in the skit appear and interact with each other. The characters in skits are animated, sometimes shaking, growing larger, or moving across the screen to accentuate what is happening in the skit. Skits can range from dramatic to comedic, and address a wide range of subjects. Some skits are related to the main plot, and some can only be obtained through optional side events. Unlike the Japanese version, the skits in the English version are not voiced.
”Grade” is awarded after each battle, either raising or lowering the player’s total number of points depending on how the battle was played. For example, defeating the enemies within a short period or time or getting a large combo will increase the grade awarded; characters being killed or having negative status effects on them will lower the grade acquired. At the end of the game, players can purchase bonuses for the next playthrough.
Abyss also features a cooking system. The player collects recipes and ingredients throughout the game, and can use them to cook either after battles or between battles. Unlike Tales of Symphonia, up to four different recipes can be set to the control pad for use after battle. Different recipes require different items and have different effects. The player can increase characters’ cooking stats for each recipe by having them cook the recipe frequently.
Abyss features titles which each character gains through a series of tasks or events. Titles have various effects, some of which are stat-related. In the tradition of newer Tales games, some of these titles also change costumes. Each character has unique costumes; to acquire additional costumes, the player must accomplish certain tasks. Unlike some other Tales games, every title in Tales of the Abyss carries a special effect, varying from discounts in shops to recovering small amounts of HP periodically.
Sorcerer’s ring
The sorcerer’s ring in Tales of the Abyss is an item that Mieu wears around his waist, and can be upgraded by the power of concentrated Fonons in certain dungeons to perform different helpful actions. These include Mieu Fire, where Mieu blows a ball of fire straight forward, used to activate switches and solve various puzzles; Mieu Attack, where Mieu is propelled forward to break objects and hit switches; and Mieu Wings, where Mieu flaps his ears and lifts the player characters into the air, useful for reaching high platforms and ladders.
Game economy
Various plot events alter the game’s economy, changing prices and item availability in shops; for instance, a shortage in the farming town of Engeve causes food prices to skyrocket, while the outbreak of war leads to a high variety equipment being sold at premium rates—and, consequently, higher profits when selling old gear.[citation needed] Furthermore, the player’s actions may alter the prices or even the availability of items available for sale.
North American PS2 exclusives
The North American version of Tales of the Abyss received extra features that are not present in the Japanese version. Guy, Natalia, Van and others gained new Mystic Artes. In addition to receiving a new Mystic Arte herself, Nebilim also gained the use of some of the playable characters’ Mystic Artes. Luke and Tear also received new Mystic Arte extensions. Although it is not an ”extra feature”, the Unknown difficulty for the North American release was modified to be a bit easier for players, with enemy stats multiplied by 3.5 rather than the original x4 in the Japanese version. These additions and alterations were carried over to the game’s Nintendo 3DS port.

Nintendo 3DS port

In September 2010, it was revealed at a Nintendo press conference that a port of the game would be coming to the Nintendo 3DS, with a planned release in 2011. The port will make use of the 3D and dual screen capabilities of the system, has new artwork designed by Kousuke Fujishima, and has a recolored logo, similar to the recoloring of Tales of Symphonia and Tales of Vesperia’s logos for their respective PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 ports. On April 5, 2011, Namco Bandai announced that the 3DS port for Japan had been delayed, but that more release information would be released when available. On April 27, 2011, magazine Nintendo Power has confirmed that the 3DS port will be making its way to North America. The game has been released in Europe for the first time as well.

Reception

Overall, reviews for the game have been positive, earning a 79% average on Game Rankings as of August 2008.
The game has been praised for its diverse cast with IGN particularly placing attention on the game’s protagonist and his ensuing character development. Others likewise praised the game’s dialogue and cut-scene direction, although some questioned both the overabundance of ”skits” which popped up from time to time as well as the localization team’s decision to omit the voice-acting that accompanied the skits in the Japanese version.
Most reviewers praised the battle system, stating that it was an improvement from earlier Tales installments while at the same time noting that it often devolved into ”mindless button mashing”. The graphics have received mixed attention. In particular, 1UP.com felt that they were ”rough around the edges” and GameSpot pointed out a drop in frame-rate on the world map, along with a generic mix of RPG locales.

"Xbox 360","Tales of Vesperia takes place on the planet Terca Lumireis. The people of Terca Lumireis have come to rely on ”blastia”, an ancient civilization’s technology with a wide array of capabilities, such as providing water, powering ships, or creating barriers around major cities and towns to protect them from monsters. The Imperial Knights and Guild members also use ”bodhi blastia” to enhance their abilities in combat. The blastia, created by the elf-like Krityans, are fueled by a substance called ”aer” that lends its power to the blastia’s ability, but can be fatal to humans in large concentrations.

When the aque blastia core is stolen from Zaphias’ lower quarter, flooding the lower class, Yuri attempts to chase down the thief, but is arrested and jailed in the castle. During his escape, he meets a young girl named Estelle who is searching for Yuri’s close friend and rival Flynn. Along with Yuri’s faithful dog Repede, the three leave the safety of Zaphias’ barrier to chase after both Flynn and the thief. On their way they encounter Karol, a young boy who joins them to catch up with his guild, the Hunting Blades, and Rita, an eccentric blastia researcher who takes great interest in Estelle’s healing magic. On their journey, Yuri learns about the state of the world and the philosophy of the guilds, who gave up their citizenship in order to live free from the rule of the Empire.

Along with Raven, a high-ranking guild member, and Judith, a mysterious Krityan woman who is hunting and destroying blastia, the group stop the machinations of an evil guild leader named Barbos and recover the aque blastia core. Yuri turns the core over to Flynn and announces his intention to form a guild with Karol, later named Brave Vesperia

Shortly afterward, Estelle is attacked by Phaeroh, a sentient monster, who calls her ”the poison of the world”. Following the attack, the new guild sets out to discover the truth behind his words. Estelle discovers that she is known as the Child of the Full Moon, an omen of the end of the world. Unlike the rest of the world, who require a blastia in order to reconstitute aer into magic, Estelle can reconstruct aer on her own: this is how she uses her healing arts. Unfortunately, this method of conversion is so efficient that it puts a great strain on the aer resources of the world, threatening to bring forth a disaster known as the Adephagos, a being that feeds off aer and would convert all life on the planet back to pure aer. The party also learn that the excessive blastia culture of the world is also threatening to strain the aer resources to breaking point, and that Judith’s mission was to destroy the blastia that were causing the most damage to the environment.

Meanwhile, Yuri, seeing how the laws of the Empire are powerless against the corruption within its officials, takes matters into his own hands and murders two corrupt officials: Ragou, a conspirator in Barbos’ plot, and Captain Cumore, a high-born knight who was using his power to commit atrocities. This brings him into conflict with Flynn, while the former is rebelling against the Empire, the latter vowed to change the Empire from within. Several times, their differences nearly come to blows.

Estelle is suddenly kidnapped by Raven, who is revealed to be Imperial Knight Schwann Oltorain. Commandant Alexei, leader of the Knights, is revealed as the mastermind who funded Barbos’ schemes in order to create a replica of the legendary sword Dein Nomos, an aer-manipulating treasure of the royal family that can open the way to a powerful weapon known as the Enduring Shrine of Zaude. Duke, a veteran of the Great War, reluctantly aids Brave Vesperia by giving them the real Dein Nomos. Chasing after Estelle, Yuri and the party are forced to fight Schwann, who has been blackmailed with his life by Alexei for ten years. Taking back control of his life, Schwann sacrifices himself to allow Brave Vesperia to escape a trap set by Alexei, and they pursue the Commandant. However, Schwann is rescued by his loyal subordinates and rejoins the party, shedding his previous life as Schwann to pledge his new life to Brave Vesperia as Raven.

Alexei takes control of Estelle’s aer-manipulation powers and, along with his False Dein Nomos, succeeds in reviving Zaude. Yuri rescues Estelle and they pursue Alexei to Zaude, where the Commandant—tasked with saving a world that he knew was killing itself through excessive blastia use—intends to use Zaude to rewrite the natural laws of the world, destroying and recreating it. Despite the best efforts of Brave Vesperia, Alexei succeeds in activating Zaude. But to everyone’s surprise, it is revealed that Zaude is not a weapon but a giant barrier blastia that Alexei has inadvertently shut down, allowing the Adephagos to seep through into the world. Realizing that his fatal mistake has doomed the world, Alexei then dies.

Rita researches a way to stop the Adephagos, and discovers a method to transform apatheia—crystallized aer, which make up the cores of blastia—into spirits, which can convert aer into a safe substitute called mana. By converting every blastia core in the world into a spirit and using it to power a massive weapon, she theorises that it would have enough strength to destroy the Adephagos. Realising that such an action would irreversibly change the entire world, Brave Vesperia meet with the leaders of the Empire and Guilds in order to ask permission to carry out such an act, and to discuss ways to prepare the world to survive without blastia: most notably, without the barrier blastia that have been protecting the major centres of population from rampaging monsters.

During this time, Flynn, who has been promoted to Acting Commandant, confronts Yuri in order to settle the outstanding issue of Yuri’s double homicide and his willingness to let Flynn take credit for all of his accomplishments (such as retrieving the aque blastia). Their swords and beliefs clash in a fight to resolve these issues. Yuri tells Flynn that he is the leader that the world needs right now, and that Yuri is happy to be a criminal in the shadows to achieve that end. Flynn accepts this, but warns that if Yuri continues to break the law then Flynn will have no choice but to stop him; an ultimatum that Yuri gladly accepts.

Brave Vesperia receive the blessing of the worlds’ leaders to carry out their plan. Unfortunately, Duke—who has lost all faith in humanity—has revived an ancient weapon called Tarqaron with the intention of sacrificing the lives of every human in the world, himself included, in order to power the weapon and destroy the Adephagos. Brave Vesperia confronts him at the peak of the hovering city, but neither can stand down due to their shared desire to save the world in their own ways. Duke and Brave Vesperia fight to resolve this, and Yuri manages to convince Duke that humanity is willing to give up their blastia to save the world. With the aid of Duke and the power of every blastia-core-turned-spirit in the world, Yuri forms a giant sword that allows him to completely destroy the Adephagos, converting it into a multitude of spirits itself and revitalizing the world. Duke simply leaves as the guild celebrates their victory.

"Wii","Tenchu: Shadow Assassins (known in Japan as Tenchu 4) is a stealth game developed by Acquire for the Wii and From Software for the PSP and published by From Software in Japan and Ubisoft in North America and Europe for Wii and the PlayStation Portable in 2008.

Story

In the land of Lord Gohda, peace has not been fully restored and rumors of betrayal have been swirling around the lord and his subjects. As a result, Lord Gohda calls upon the Azuma Ninja, Rikimaru and Ayame, to investigate. Rikimaru soon discovers that someone is planning to start a war. Meanwhile, Counselor Sekiya, Gohda’s right hand man, arranges for a fortune-teller to predict the future of Gohda’s kingdom. Unfortunately, the fortune-teller turns out to be an imposter and kidnaps Princess Kiku, Lord Gohda’s daughter.
Ayame chases after her without hesitation, while Rikimaru goes on another mission for lord Gohda instead: resume the investigation on the nuisances that have been troubling the land. He then discovers that Daimyo Tado is the one behind all this. Gohda then decides to declare war on Tado and travels to his land with Rikimaru. After Rikimaru succeeds in taking Daimyo Tado’s life, the woman who posed as the fortune-teller, a Kunoichi named Rinshi, appears and tries to kill Rikimaru, but fails thanks to the intervention of Tachibana Hyakubei, who was hired by Gohda. After Lord Gohda’s order, Rikimaru heads back to the castle. When he arrives however, he is attacked by the guards, who were ordered to consider him a traitor by Sekiya. Ayame had actually succeeded in rescuing the princess but had been attacked by someone who seemed to be Rikimaru, who was actually Rinshi in disguise. Ayame and Kiku then flee the castle as the real Rikimaru arrives, and the two women head for a secret hideout suggested by Sekiya. The Princess then reveals to be Rinshi in disguise and wounds Ayame, but Rikimaru arrives just in time to save her and kills Rinshi.
Gohda, noticing his castle in flames, realizes that it was all Sekiya’s doing and orders Rikimaru to get back there and eliminate him. After he seemingly takes Sekiya’s life and saves Kiku, Sekiya rises again and reveals himself to be Onikage, who then challenges Rikimaru to a duel. Rikimaru ultimately gains the upper hand but Onikage uses the princess as a shield, forcing Rikimaru to drive his sword through her to get to Onikage and kill him. Ayame, who had followed Rikimaru, cries upon Kiku’s death. The extended ending (attained by collecting all of the map pieces in normal mode) shows Ayame speaking in Onikage’s voice, suggesting his hatred survived in her since Rikimaru murdered her best friend.

Characters

Rinshi - A mysterious kunoichi who disguised herself as a fortune-teller during the first attempt of kidnapping Kiku. Sekiya was fooled by letting her inside the castle. Later on, she reveals that her motive is actually to avenge the deaths of her parents because of Gohda.
Sekiya - The trusted right-hand man of Gohda. It is noticeable that he could also give orders to the Azuma ninjas even without the accordance of Gohda. In Tenchu: Shadow Assassins, it is revealed that the Sekiya during those times was just an impostor and turned out to be Onikage. It is not revealed where the real Sekiya is or if he was already dead during the events of Wrath of Heaven when he was attacked by a shikigami.
Tado - A vicious daimyo who wished to start a war with Lord Gohda. He later dies after Rikimaru poisons his sake.
Onikage - A mysterious, demonic ninja who seems to have some sort of past connection with the Azuma clan.

Gameplay

Shadow Assassins allows players to take control of both Rikimaru and Ayame. The camera is an over-the-shoulder point of view. All of the 10 missions are ground-based. Players will play the first five stages and the last one using Rikimaru and stages six to nine as Ayame. There are also 50 side missions called ”Assignments”.
Ayame is faster but weaker, making it harder for her to hide bodies. According to From Software, their stages are also completely different, Rikimaru’s more straightforward, while Ayame’s being ”a little trickier, she can use the environment more.” There are about 10 multi-purpose items in the game, for example a cat can be used as distraction or as a scout.
On Wii, players use the Wii Remote’s analog stick to move, A button for actions, holding B button while moving forward to run or while moving sideways to strafe and uses the C button for jumping (a long jump can be performed while running). Wii Remote is also used for first-person perspective sword fighting.
The gameplay of the PlayStation Portable version is generally the same. However, controls have been altered to fit the console’s functionalities, thus removing the motion controls, although some similar controls have been retained such as moving the analog stick of the PSP to move forward and pressing the D-pad to choose between items in the player’s arsenal (same functions as the Wii Remote). The controls for doing a stealth kill have been slightly changed; the player now has to press the face buttons of the PSP console to trigger it and moving the analog stick.","Ubisoft","No","Tenchu: Shadow Assassins","","","M","Action, Stealth","","8.0","2009-02-05","Acquire","1","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$5.99","$5.99","2013-08-02","","","008888174905","960725","2019-01-03 15:06:57",Collection

"Wii U","Morality is used in a system known as ”Hero or Menace”, where players will be rewarded for stopping crimes or punished for not consistently doing so or not responding. If the player responds to crimes and successfully stops them, their hero rating will go up, failing to do so will result in Spider Man’s rating to decrease.[4] The player is able to upgrade Spider-Man’s web shooters. During certain sections of the game, the player can control Spider-Man’s alter ego Peter Parker and walk around doing detective work.

Players have access to Peter Parker’s home, and his room allows players to replay previous missions from the main storyline, purchase upgrades and equip the various costumes available.[5] Audio logs of many characters can be collected from around the city. Players can use the Metro to go back to Peter Parker’s home.

Additionally, new enemy types have been introduced.[5] Armored guards can be taken down either with a stealth attack or by the Ionic Web upgrade, which allows players to break down armor, thus leaving the guard vulnerable to damage.","Activision","No","The Amazing Spider-Man 2","","","T","Action, Adventure","","5.4","2014-05-02","Activision","1-2","United States","Controller Game Pad","Blu-Ray Disc","","1","Colored Snap Case","1","","$10.96","2020-01-01","Complete In Case","Game Over - Online","047875849426","1348795","2020-01-20 19:48:44",Collection

"Xbox 360","Starbreeze, makers of the highly acclaimed Escape from Butcher Bay, are back as well, updating the visuals from the original, adding on a full-blown sequel as well as online multiplayer. For some, this collection will be a nostalgic look back at one of the best movie-licensed videogames ever made. For others, it’s an introduction to Riddick and a rare style of gameplay, one that fuses stealth and the traditional first-person shooter. 

Escape from Butcher Bay has been faithfully updated with hi-def graphics and sounds and the bonus mech sequence previously only available in the PC version. Though it’s five years old, there are elements that are still strikingly fresh and original.","Atari","","The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena","","","M","Action, First Person Shooter, Stealth","","7.4","2009-04-07","Starbreeze Studios","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$6.29","$6.29","2013-06-02","","","742725278882","902514","2019-01-03 15:06:48",Collection

"Xbox 360","The Darkness II takes players down a brutal and personal path as Jackie Estacado, wielder of The Darkness -- an ancient and ruthless force of chaos and destruction. Based on the supernatural horror comic book series created by Top Cow Productions, Inc., The Darkness II breaks out of the sea of conventional first-person shooters with its fervid Quad-Wielding gameplay, which will allow players to slash, grab, and throw objects and enemies with their Demon Arms while simultaneously firing two weapons. The game is layered with the use of dark versus light, steeped in deep and twisted storytelling, and engulfed in stylistic violence that is visualized through a hand-painted graphic noir technique that stays true to its comic book origins.
It’s been two years since Jackie Estacado, now the Don of the Franchetti crime family, used The Darkness to kill the men responsible for his girlfriend’s murder. He’s been unable to shake the memory of Jenny’s death since bottling up his supernatural power, and now The Darkness wants out. A sudden, unprovoked attack on Jackie’s life heralds the start of a full-scale mob war, which has clearly been orchestrated by some outside force. The botched attempt opens the door for The Darkness to reemerge, and sets Jackie on a journey to hell and worse, as he unravels the mystery behind the attack and the motivations of The Darkness itself.","2K Games","No","The Darkness II","","","M","Action","","8","2012-02-07","Digital Extreme","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$5.40","$5.40","2013-05-19","","","710425491092","1209245","2019-01-03 15:06:50",Collection

"Wii","The Last Story (\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc Rasuto Sut\u014dr\u012b) is a 2011 third-person action role-playing game with stealth and strategy elements, directed by Hironobu Sakaguchi and developed by Mistwalker and AQ Interactive for the Wii. It was published by Nintendo in Japan and Europe and will be published by Xseed Games in North America. The game’s name and logo have been compared to the Final Fantasy series, which was created by Mistwalker’s head, Hironobu Sakaguchi, who previously held the post of executive producer for the Final Fantasy series.

Reception
 
The Last Story has received critical acclaim from reviewers. The game received a score of 38/40 in Famitsu magazine, with two critics giving the game 10/10 and two giving the game 9/10. The Last Story topped the Japanese charts, with 114,722 units in its first week \u2013 which also includes sales of a version that comes bundled with a Wii system.By the end of 2011, the game had sold nearly 160,000 copies in Japan.
The UK’s Edge Magazine gave the game a score of 8 out of 10 in their April 2011 issue (#E226). gave it a score of 8 out of 10, praising the story, system, and voice acting, while noting its simplicity. XGN gave the game a score of 9 out of 10, highly praising the game stating, ”Mistwalker once again delivers an interesting and deep role-playing game that also manages to innovate the RPG-genre in some aspects. A convincing story, combined with a unique combat system and a great audiovisual presentation, makes The Last Story a must-have game for anyone who has a special place in their heart for special RPG’s.” Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game an 86% score, describing it as a ”brash, engaging tale of swords, sorcery and every sort of hair dye.” MeriStation gave the game a score of 9 out of 10, stating that ”Sakaguchi knows how to make great JRPGs. The Last Story is a memorable and magical work. The combat system is brilliant, it’s fun, and Nobuo Uematsu’s music helps you to remember the great games of the genre.” According to Metro GameCentral, which gave it an 8 out of 10, the ”creator of Final Fantasy reinvents the Japanese role-player, with a game that mixes innovative action with likeable characters and even online co-op.” The reviewer Roger Hargreaves described the cover system as one ”that even many Western shooters would struggle to match,” and praised the ability to ”issue commands almost like a real-time strategy” and the ”highly varied set pieces.” Cubed3 described the game as being ”far superior” to Final Fantasy XIII-2 in ”almost every category.”
IGN gave it an overall 8.5 out of 10, including a 9 out of 10 for gameplay, with reviewer Keza MacDonald describing it as ”a gift to the Wii,” stating that it ”swirls the best of JRPG characterisation, presentation, customisation and storytelling together with third-person action combat and elements of stealth and real-time strategy.” She praised the ”superb” British localisation and stated that it has ”one of the best combat systems I’ve played with in any RPG, Japanese or otherwise,” with an online deathmatch mode showing ”just how strong the combat mechanics are” as there ”aren’t many RPGs whose battle system would be enough on its own to support a feature like this.” GameSpot gave the game a score of 9 out of 10 and an Editors’ Choice award, describing it as ”a brilliant role-playing game that’s as rich and emotionally affecting as the best in the genre.” The reviewer Mark Walton concluded that it is ”a fantastic game; one that pushes the JRPG genre forward in ways that are innovative yet still complementary to the tradition of the genre.”","XSEED Games","No","The Last Story","","","T","Role Playing Game","","8.5","2012-08-14","Mistwalker","1","Canada","Controller Game Pad","DVD","Yes","1","Box Set","1","$49.99","$49.99","2012-08-14","","","853466001513","1575180","2019-01-03 15:06:36",Collection

Explore the wilds of Hyrule any way you like
Climb up towers and mountain peaks in search of new destinations, then set your own path to get there and plunge into the wilderness. Along the way, you’ll battle towering enemies, hunt wild beasts and gather ingredients for the food and elixirs you’ll need to sustain you on your journey. 

More than 100 Shrines of Trials to discover and explore
Shrines dot the landscape, waiting to be discovered in any order you want. Search for them in various ways, and solve a variety of puzzles inside. Work your way through the traps and devices inside to earn special items and other rewards that will help you on your adventure. 

Be prepared and properly equipped
With an entire world waiting to be explored, you’ll need a variety of outfits and gear to reach every corner.

Some clothing even has special effects that, for example, can make you faster and stealthier.

"Super NES","You play as Buster Bunny, in a series of levels, featuring characters from the Tiny Toon Adventures cartoon.

Most of the six levels are platform levels, where Buster has a number of attacks to defeat the enemies he faces. These include kicks and jumps, and a dash ability that lets you slide into enemies to defeat them, and also climb walls.

The fourth level is an exception, and consists of a game of (American) football, played with a simplified version of the rules. The idea is simply to get a touchdown, while as usual progressing at least ten yards in four downs. There are two plays: a running play, where you simply run as far as possible while avoiding the opposing team; and a passing play that starts with a pass that can gain you extra yards, but must be caught.

Between levels there are bonus games. You spin a wheel to determine what game you play out of five available.","Konami","No","Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose!","","","E","Action, Adventure","","7.6","1993-06-24","Konami","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","Cartridge","No","1","Box Set","1","","","","","","083717150091","1119193","2019-01-03 15:06:13",Collection

"Xbox 360","Transformers: War for Cybertron is a third-person shooter video game developed by High Moon Studios and published by Activision. It was released in North America on June 22, 2010 and in PAL regions on June 25, 2010 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC. Two portable versions were released for the Nintendo DS, one featuring an Autobot campaign, the other a Decepticon campaign. A game for the Wii called Transformers: Cybertron Adventures was developed by Next Level Games and utilizes the same characters and setting as War for Cybertron. The game takes place on the planet Cybertron, prior to the Transformers arrival on Earth. The Autobots and Decepticons are engaged in a civil war. The game can be played starting from either faction’s perspective, but begins chronologically with the Decepticon campaign. The game revolves around the use of a substance known as Dark Energon, which the Decepticon leader Megatron believes will allow him to return the planet to what he refers to as a golden age. War for Cybertron received generally positive reviews from critics. Aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic report scores in the mid 70% range across all three platforms. Several reviewers cited it as an improvement over past Transformers games. Critics generally felt that the cooperative and multiplayer versus modes were solid, but cited repetitive visuals in regards to the game’s setting.","High Moon Studios","No","Transformers: War For Cybertron","","","T","Third Person Shooter","","9.0","2010-06-22","Activision Blizzard","1","United States","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","","","","","","047875839076","1214958","2019-01-03 15:06:00",Collection

"Wii","Second Opinion é um simulador em primeira pessoa, o qual coloca você na pele de um jovem cirurgião que deve realizar operações bem sucedidas e cada vez mais complexas. O título estréia no Nintendo Wii, como uma ótima adaptação de Trauma Center: Under the Knife, lançado no portátil DS em 2005.
 
Em Trauma Center: Second Opinion, você joga como Dr. Stiles, um médico que, ainda inseguro quanto ao seu potencial, precisa realizar as mais diversas cirurgias, desde procedimentos de rotina, até o combate de um vírus letal, que irá causar graves distúrbios em seus pacientes no decorrer do jogo. 
 
Para realizar os procedimentos e manter os sinais do paciente elevados durante as operações, o jogador tem a sua disposição vários instrumentos, como bisturi, laser cirúrgico, dreno, ultrassom, desfribilador, entre outros. Os aparelhos são selecionados com o botão analógico do Nunchuck (na mão esquerda) e utilizados com o controle remoto do Wii (na mão direita). O esquema de comandos confere certo realismo ao jogo, pois os movimentos que o jogador executa com o controle remoto são reproduzidos na tela, graças ao sensor de movimento do console.
 
Um dos cuidados dos desenvolvedores foi disponibilizar gráficos que não agridam ao espectador, sendo os órgãos internos representados de uma forma mais próxima ao desenho animado. A música de fundo, que fica mais intensa nos momentos críticos, e o som dos sinais vitais do paciente ajudam a criar a atmosfera de tensão durante os procedimentos cirúrgicos. Por tudo isso, Trauma Center: Second Opinion é recomendado para quem está a procura de uma proposta diferente e uma história envolvente aliada a momentos de puro suspense.

Com a diferente proposta de salvar vidas ao realizar cirurgias cada vez mais complexas, Trauma Center: Second Opinion chega como uma ótima adaptação para o novo console da Nintendo, utilizando-se perfeitamente de seus controles e de seu sensor de movimento. Neste jogo, você é o Dr. Stiles, um médico recém-formado que, ainda não muito confiante quanto as suas habilidades como cirurgião, terá que provar para os colegas e para si mesmo que merece o cargo que acabou de ocupar. Os primeiros estágios facilitam a aprendizagem do esquema de controles a ser utilizado na sala de operações e, apesar da simplicidade da narração, que faz referência ao estilo narrativo de mangás, a diversão é garantida pela tensão das cirurgias que ficam cada vez mais complexas com o seu progresso no jogo.
Salvando Vidas no Hope Hospital
Second Opinion está mais para uma adaptação para o novo console da Nintendo, do que propriamente uma seqüência narrativa do Trauma Center: Under the Knife (lançado em 2005 para DS), que conta com o mesmo protagonista e enredo. Nesse novo título, além da qualidade gráfica melhorada e novas situações encorporadas, um novo esquema de controles foi desenvolvido, de forma a contemplar as novas possibilidades que o Nintendo Wii oferece.
Em Trauma Center: Second Opinion, o jogo se passa no Hope Hospital, no centro da cidade de Angeles Bay, onde o inseguro Dr. Stiles vive os primeiros dias de sua carreira como cirurgião, contando com o apoio e compreensão de seus chefes e colegas de trabalho. Mas essa história apresentará reviravoltas e os outros profissionais passarão a cobrar melhores resultados com o passar do tempo. Além disso, o enredo de Trauma Center tem uma importância maior do que simplesmente uma pausa levemente humorada entre uma cirurgia e outra, pois é preciso estar atento as instruções dos outros profissionais para se saber exatamente o que fazer durante as cirurgias.
O jogo apresenta uma progressão linear, ou seja, há um único caminho a ser percorrido e a complexidade das cirurgias vai aumentando cada vez mais. Para que haja a continuidade na narração, todas as operações devem ser realizadas até um certo limite de tempo e sem ocasionar o falecimento do paciente - caso contrário, deverão ser refeitas até se obter sucesso.
Cirurgias cada vez mais complexas
A complexidade do jogo aumenta gradativamente a cada procedimento e todos eles — desde a remoção de múltiplos tumores até o combate de um vírus letal, que irá causar graves distúrbios em seus pacientes no decorrer do jogo — trazem complicações inesperadas. Nas primeiras duas cirurgias, devem ser empregados diferentes procedimentos, como corte, sutura, retirada de tumor e drenagem, que são orientados passo a passo pela enfermeira assistente. Nas operações seguintes, cabe ao jogador lembrar todos os passos e executá-los a tempo, mantendo estáveis os sinais vitais do paciente.
Assim, Trauma Center apresenta a fórmula ideal de desafio, facilitando a aprendizagem do jogador nos primeiros momentos e aumentando a complexidade sutilmente, sem deixá-lo entediado ou totalmente perdido. Há três níveis de dificuldade e, em todos eles, é relativamente fácil ser bem sucedido, mas um tanto difícil alcançar a melhor nota. No sistema de avaliação, feito ao final de cada procedimento cirúrgico, são levados em conta o tempo transcorrido, os erros cometidos e a precisão dos cortes, entre outros quesitos.
Com o bisturi na mão
A transição de um console portátil para o sensor de movimento do Wii foi bem realizada - tanto que é difícil pensar em outro esquema de controles que se adaptaria melhor a proposta do jogo. Pode-se até dizer que este é um dos jogos que se utiliza das possibilidades do Wii de maneira mais criativa.
Com a alavanca analógica do nunchuck, você escolhe a ferramenta a ser utilizada (entre bisturi, dreno, seringa, antibiótico, ultra-som, laser e outros) e com controle remoto você realiza as operações específicas de cada objeto, pressionando o botão A e movendo o controle sobre a área assinalada. Então, para costurar um corte é preciso selecionar a agulha com o nunchuck em uma mão e, com a outra, mover o controle remoto em zigue-zague pelas bordas da ferida, a fim de imitar o movimento de sutura, fechando o corte.
Talvez o procedimento mais difícil de ser perfeitamente realizado seja o de corte com o bisturi, pois não é fácil fazer um corte reto e preciso com o controle do Wii, que responde muito bem a qualquer oscilação no movimento. A cicatriz deixada no paciente após a utilização do bisturi e a realização da sutura é um dos quesitos avaliados para conferir nota ao desempenho do jogador.
Cirurgias que não causam náuseas
Trauma Center: Second Opinion apresenta gráficos no estilo anime, o qual é peculiar na representação do rosto dos personagens e de suas expressões, como raiva ou constrangimento. Apesar de ter um visual razoável - compatível com as limitações do Wii - o jogo carece de animação gráfica durante a narração dos eventos, pois aparecem na tela apenas a imagem estática de um personagem e a sua fala por escrito.
Mas uma das maiores realizações do jogo foi representar bem, durante as cirurgias, os instrumentos utilizados e os órgãos internos, com seus tumores e ferimentos, sem agredir ao espectador. Portanto, se você tem náuseas ao assistir a uma operação, não se preocupe, pois a ação no jogo não é tão realista ou apelativa, pois parece mais um desenho animado.
Tensão Sonora
As vozes dos personagens aparecem durante os momentos importantes da cirurgia, como quando os sinais vitais estão muito baixos. A tensão das operações é provocada pelo som dos batimentos cardíacos do paciente - que caem a todo o momento - aliada a música de fundo, que fica mais forte, nesses momentos mais críticos.
Novamente, a narração perde muito, devido a falta da voz dos personagens durante suas falas, que são muito bem escritas e levemente humoradas. Apesar disso, tudo tem uma boa representação sonora, desde os passos das pessoas até o ranger de uma porta abrindo.
Diversão Garantida
Trauma Center: Second Opinion apresenta a fórmula quase perfeita de equilíbrio entre a tensão das cirurgias e o enredo envolvente. O jogador não se entedia durante a narração, que é curta e tem um roteiro bem escrito. A tensão durante as operações não é prolongada devido ao tempo que, mesmo limitado, é suficiente para prender a atenção do jogador e fazer com que ele queira repetir o procedimento, se necessário. Assim, a diversão é garantida até o último episódio desta aventura diferente e muito criativa, capaz de agradar a públicos de todos os gostos.","Atlus","No","Trauma Center Second Opinion","","","T","Simulation","","8.0","2006-11-14","Atlus","1","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$4.49","$4.49","2013-05-24","","","730865700011","1149366","2019-01-03 15:06:51",Collection

"DS","Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume (ヴァルキリープロファイル 咎を背� う者 Varukirī Purofairu Toga o Seou Mono, lit. Valkyrie Profile: The Accused One(s)) is the third installment in the Valkyrie Profile series of role-playing games. It was developed by tri-Ace and published by Square Enix for the Nintendo DS, released on November 1, 2008 in Japan; on March 17, 2009 in North America; and in all PAL regions on April 3, 2009.

Gameplay

Characters talking during a dialogue sequence.
Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume’s gameplay is presented mainly from an isometric view, similarly to Final Fantasy Tactics. The player’s two-dimensional character sprites move about on a three-dimensional map akin to those of a tactical role-playing game. Characters can attack enemies individually or can actively support each other via the Mutual Assist system. When an enemy is in range of up to four characters, an exclamation mark will appear, indicating that the character is ready to attack. Up to four characters are mapped to the A, B, X, and Y buttons, which are used to attack. Each successful attack fills up the Attack Gauge; when it reaches 100, characters can perform powerful attacks called Soul Crushes.

The position of characters around enemies during combat can be exploited in a feature called the Active Formation system. Aligning characters in certain formations can increase the rate of item drops or speed at which the Attack Gauge increases. Active Formations include the Flank Raid with two characters on opposite sides of an enemy, Axis Raid with two characters in front of and behind an enemy, Trinity Fork where characters surround the enemy on 3 sides, and Grand Cross where characters surround an enemy on all four sides. Another new factor in battle involves the Destiny Plume. By invoking the power of the plume, the player can chose to temporarily grant an ally improved statistics and abilities but once the battle ends, the Destiny Plume overwhelms that character’s physical form and they die permanently. Using the plume affects the outcome of the plot, leading to different branches of the story or even game over, should the player overuse the plume.

Another aspect to combat is the accumulation of Sin. Sin is gained by inflicting damage against an enemy whose HP has already been depleted. Most of the battles in the storyline have a predetermined amount of Sin the player must harvest to appease Hel. If the appropriate amount of Sin is accumulated by the end of battle, the player will be rewarded with items and equipment but if the amount is not reached, the player will face a set of extremely difficult and powerful enemies.

Reception

Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume has received mostly positive reviews.

The game debuted on the Japanese sales charts at number two, selling 80,000 copies. It was the 97th best-selling game in Japan in 2008, selling 136,948 copies. As of May 31, 2009, the game has sold 230,000 copies worldwide. Hyper’s Daniel Wilks commends the game for being ”very dark in tone and gameplay mechanics, forces long term strategy” but criticises it for its ”punishing, steep difficulty curve”.","Square Enix","No","Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume","","","T","Strategy","","8.5","2009-03-16","Tri-Ace","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","$9.99","$9.99","2011-02-18","Used","Complete in Case

"DS","Already hailed by TimeForKids.com as ”the best of the toy world and video-game world”, Wappy Dog teaches young gamers to raise their very own puppy in both the real and virtual worlds and teach it cool tricks, play mini-games together and even converse! Each pet is a fully personalized experience, enabling players to customize both the in-game version and physical dog with different colors and accessories.

The player’s interaction with their Wappy Dog determines the pet’s constantly evolving personality, skills, and happiness. Players communicate with Wappy using commands given through the Nintendo DS and he responds both virtually, by wagging its tail among other tricks, and physically, with vocal barks and movements, just like a real pet! One that also sings and dances that is.

Players choose between ”Home Mode”, which enables them to engage with Wappy Dog through the Nintendo DS, or ”Travel Mode”, which gives on-the-go players a chance to continue caring for and playing with their pet virtually without the physical dog. When the player returns home, their dog’s progress instantly transfers to the toy as if they’ve never been apart.

Communication and Interaction with Wappy - more than 18 conversational prompts are answered with more than 350 evolving responses, with each ”barked” response translated by the Nintendo DS software. Some of the exciting interactions include Wappy singing adorable tunes in ”Home Mode” or moonwalking its paws off when in ”Travel Mode”!
Intelligent and Engaging Behavior - Building a healthy and happy friendship is the key to unlocking Wappy’s many tricks. Five mood states are reflected by the colors of Wappy’s cheeks; an unhappy Wappy will be uncooperative and stubborn, so it is vital for players to keep its cheeks shining bright. With easily recognizable color schemes, young players will know how Wappy is feeling at any moment.
Fun and Exciting Mini-Games - Thrilling games build a healthy bond between pet and owner; Cooperative, competitive or supportive games will continue to develop the friendship while simultaneously unlocking more games for even more exciting experiences. Wappy will directly participate in games and cheers when it wins or sulks when it loses.
Nurture and Care for Wappy - Wappy’s ni c kname can be chosen by the player who will enjoy feeding, bathing and changing Wappy’s style as it matures from a puppy to an adult. Five uniquely varied age states will be accompanied by changing reactions, songs and even the pitch of its voice. Players will love caring for Wappy from precocious puppy tyke to blissfully happy adult pooch.","Activision","No","Wappy Dog","","","E","Educational, Simulation","","8.0","2011-11-08","Sega Toys","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","Yes","","Box Set","1","","$9.73","2013-05-23","Complete In Box - Packaging Damaged","Amazon","047875765504","1205317","2021-06-10 01:59:44",Collection

DS has all of the frantic five-second microgame action of the previous games, but with a touching new twist: you can play every microgame with the Nintendo DS touch screen. Many games will even utilize the system’s built-in microphone. Players have to slice fruit as they fly across the screen, trap a duck as it walks under a cage, pluck a large facial hair by its root, spin a toilet paper roll until it’s bare, hit a row of cats as they leap out, and many more. The game uses the two DS screens to present a double-high version of the familiar ”squigglevision” elevator used in the Game Boy Advance and GameCube versions of Wario Ware, and when the door opens, it reveals the mini-game on the lower screen.","Nintendo","No","WarioWare: Touched!","","","E","Compilation","","8*5","2005-02-14","Nintendo","1","United States","Handheld Console","Cartridge","No","1","Snap Case","1","","$8.99","2012-04-22","Used","Complete in Case

"Xbox","Yager is a shooter video game for the Xbox console, later ported to Windows. In the game, the on the role of Magnus Tide, a freelance pilot adventurer. Yager, a single-player shooting game, is set over 20 levels in which the player takes possession of various weapons and ships in an effort to accomplish each mission. Yager was published by Kemco (in NA) or by THQ (Europe) and developed by Yager Development.

Although the game was fairly well-received by critics, it ultimately never reached the living rooms of most American gamers. The main reason behind this was that the game was ”old” by the time it reached North American store shelves, as it had been released in Europe two years prior and it suffered from a lack of advertising.","THQ","","Yager","","","T","Action, Side Scrolling, Simulation","","9.2/10","2003-05-23","Kemco","1","Australia","Controller Game Pad","DVD","No","1","Colored Snap Case","1","$7.11","$7.11","2013-02-23","","","4005209036351","976176","2019-01-03 15:06:40",Collection

"Nintendo 64","Yoshi’s Story (ヨッシーストーリー Yosshī Sutōrī?) is a side-scrolling platform game, published and developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 entertainment system. It is the sequel to the Super Nintendo game Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island. It was released on December 21, 1997 in Japan, March 1, 1998 in North America and April 9, 1998 in Europe. It was re-released on the Wii’s Virtual Console service in North America on September 17, 2007, in PAL regions on October 26, 2007 and in Japan on October 30, 2007. The game was developed by the Yoshi’s Island team, designed by Hideki Konno, and produced by Takashi Tezuka. It was one of the first EAD-developed titles that was not produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, and one of a very few Mario series games that does not feature Mario. Critical reception to Yoshi’s Story was mixed; the game received criticism and praise for its controls, levels, music, and childlike atmosphere, but it was commonly criticized for being too much a departure from its predecessor.","Nintendo","No","Yoshi’s Story","","","E","Platform, Side Scrolling","","7.0","1998-03-10","Nintendo","1","Switzerland","Controller Game Pad","Cartridge","No","0","Cardboard Box","1","","","","","","045496870171","1076762","2019-01-03 15:06:07",Collection

"Wii","In this game, you are in control of a cute little pirate named Zack who’s out to solve puzzles and discover the legendary treasure that was hidden away on Treasure Island by the great pirate Barbaros. Played with the Wii Remote like a classic adventure game, gamers point and click at objects they would like to use as they try to solve puzzles and get further into the game. Once you figure out what you need to use to solve a puzzle, you also need to discover how to use it, which is often by a series of natural motions and button presses with the controller. Puzzles start off simple but promise to get tougher as the game progresses. If you’re having trouble, you can consult a friend for hints. The goal is to clear the stages without getting any hints. Prior to the start of a stage, the game shares with you the percentage of testers who were able to clear the stage on their own, so you can get a feel for the difficulty.","Capcom","No","Zack & Wiki: Quest For Barbaros’ Treasure","","","E","Platform, Puzzle","","9.0","2007-10-23","Capcom","1","United States","Motion Sensing Remote","DVD","No","1","Snap Case","1","$6.29","$6.29","2013-07-13","","","013388350018","1575262","2019-01-03 15:06:53",Collection
