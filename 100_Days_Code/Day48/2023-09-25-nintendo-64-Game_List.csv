The reasoning behind this decision was never spoken of by Ubisoft but it is widely speculated that the Brazilian markets were more receptive to Formula 1 racing games (along side PAL regions) and a US release was planned but cancelled. The game was picked up by Brazilian company Gradiente and they were the ones who released the game in Brazil. The game itself is 100% in English but the manual, box and inserts are all in Portuguese. If you are looking to get a copy, you best bet importing this would be either eBay or the Brazilian equivalent (mercadolivre.com.br). Just be aware that the Brazilian site often will not ship outside the country of Brazil. While expansion pak support was planned (and the game has a pop up screen telling you it was detected), the developers decided not to use it for upgraded textures as the  8mb RAM was still not quite enough. Although Nintendo is also very popular in Brazil, soon after the N64, Sony gained major market share and Nintendo fans became more of a niche group in comparison.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/f1-racing-championship

Pokemon Stadium allows Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow owners the chance to fight Pokemon battles on their televisions, allowing you to transfer your collection onto your Nintendo 64 and fight in a huge arena. Seeing your Pokemon in a much larger form is spectacular, and each attack you've given your Pokemon can now be viewed in glorious colour, with every single move animated.

Fan favourites such as Charmander, Pikachu and Blastoise can now be seen in their full glory, and you can take your team into battle against a friends team or against a selection controlled by the computer.

As well as the customary battles, there are a selection of mini-games for you to enjoy, with the highlight a game where you have to devour a selection of food dishes on a moving rail, dodging the undercooked meals as you try to rack up a high score.

The PlayStation version with two CD-ROMs of up to 700 MB per disc was faithfully replicated (with unique enhancements) on a 64 MB Nintendo 64 Game Pak. Audio and video assets had to be more aggressively and creatively compressed, using novel techniques that shift the burden more toward the console's high real-time processing power. Over the course of twelve months and with a budget of $1 million, Resident Evil 2 was ported to the console by a team led by nine full-time and one part-time personnel from Angel Studios.

The N64 version of RE2 has unique features such as a difficulty that randomizes items, editing blood color, and new EX Files that reference other games in the Resident Evil series.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/resident-evil-2

Depending on the location, a Blockbuster patron renting this game either rented the complete game (box, manual, and cartridge) or just the cartridge and manual. Oftentimes, the outer box was used as the store display box which explains the lack of a price on many of the price stickers that are found on a majority of surviving boxes. Due to the nature of game rentals, the cartridges were sometimes cracked or damaged physically over their rental lifespan, while the manuals often went home with the first person to rent the game and were returned damaged, destroyed, or not returned at all. Furthermore, some Blockbuster store employees would discard the boxes and manuals when the games were put out for rental per the store manager or other policy. As with many other Nintendo 64 Blockbuster rental exclusive games, these conditions resulted in a very rare game to find in mint, complete condition. These rarity conditions place a complete copy of Stunt Racer 64, including cartridge, box, and manual, near the top of the list of Rarest Nintendo 64 games.",https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/stunt-racer
